When I click an IntelliJ menu (e.g. \"View\") on my main display (only option) and IntelliJ is on another display, the menu closes immediately. :S\n\nI don't remember having this issue until I turned off \"Displays have separate Spaces\" per the recommendation.\n\nThe macOS setting is tied to whether or not the menu bar appears on every display.","files":null}]}
