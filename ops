Setup Raycast to open it's `Search Emojii \u0026 Symbols` floating window via `Alt+Shift+Space`.\n2. Open Chrome (or any other application)\n3. Press `Alt+Shift+Space` to bring up the `Search Emojii \u0026 Symbols` window. (Note: Invoking Raycast itself first and then selecting `Search Emojii \u0026 Symbols` doesn't cause the issue, it has to be via the keyboard shortcut)\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `Search Emojii \u0026 Symbols` should float, but the Chrome window (or whatever the parent window was) is not impacted.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe parent window is being switched into floating mode. Restoring tiling mode via `layout floating tiling` which I have mapped to `alt+s f` fixes the situation.\n\nhttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/15000/8e243408-71db-4619-b851-611334fe7d0b\n\nThank you so much for creating this project. Please let me know if this report makes sense or if I can provide more information.","files":null}]}
