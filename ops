So if you open multiple projects, there are separate windows that occupy the same coordinates, and when you switch to the application, you get the most recent project. Then, the most practical way to switch projects is to do so in the application's project switcher, which then takes you to the correct window.

That does diminish the information about how many applications are open on a workspace, but in a way that is actually beneficial in certain cases.\n\n---\n\nAlso, I completely understand if this is rejected out of hand for adding complexity or ambiguity, but I'm curious if others run into this same thing.
