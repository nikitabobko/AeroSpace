It seems like #57 is about layouts (which doesn't matter here, where we just want the windows on the correct workspaces), and about specific layouts / workspaces that in general will not change.\n\nThis issue is more like how when you quit chrome and have 5 different windows with different tabs in each window, when you start it up again (if you have the config option enabled), all windows open up again with all tabs in their respective windows.  It's about taking a current snapshot and restoring it later on (if the window exists at the time that AeroSpace is started).","files":null}]}
