Whenever I've two instances of an application open (say firefox or kitty) on multiple monitors. It will focus the instance of the app I last used. I'll try to explain it with an example:\n\nI've a three monitor setup: `1 | 2 | *0`\n\n* Workspace 1 contains a kitty window.\n* Workspace 2 contains a kitty window\n* Workspace 0 contains something else, say firefox.\n\nI've the following keybinds to go the specific workspaces:\n```\nalt-1 = 'workspace 1'\nalt-2 = 'workspace 2'\n```\n\nI want to go to workspace 1 so I press `alt-1`. I end up at workspace 2. If I press `alt-1` again I'll go to workspace 1 as expected. \n\nIs this working as intended? I would like to be able to actually focus a specific window/instance of an app.\n\nLove the app so far, is there a way we can buy you a coffee or beer?","files":null}]}
