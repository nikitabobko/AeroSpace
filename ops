Have you tried the karabiner configuration I pasted? This absolutely resolves the problem, I am using right option key for accented letters, and left option key for workspace switching. \n\nThe underlying issue is IMHO beyond the scope of AeroSpace as the solutions require a keyboard driver like e.g. karabiner. And as the author [pointed out](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/28#issuecomment-1837477297) other projects have the same limitation. I am not sure how [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/issues/1) is able to differentiate between `lalt` and `ralt` so that may be a path to venture for understanding and addressing this.\n\nHowever, as I am using karabiner anyway, adding a line of configuration was easier for me than looking into the code of both projects and porting the solution from skhd.","files":null}]}
