An example of such a keyboard mapping in macOS is the \"ABC - Extended\" keyboard.\n\nIn aerospace config, it should be possible to specify a modifier (eg. lalt) that corresponds to only the left alt key, so that the right alt key can be used to type these special characters without triggering aerospace actions. \n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
