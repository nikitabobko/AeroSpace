Once I'm in each row though, I would like the ability to move left and right using prev/next, since the necessary windows for a given task are located close to each other, but since it's sorted alphabetically that's not possible at the moment.\n\nI do like the idea of config file order, since that'll allow the user to define whichever order fits their use case, and it should be fairly easy to implement.","files":null}]}
