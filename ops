The only way I could effectively build the HEAD version of this package was by opening it with Xcode.\n\nWhen I try to run the `./install-from-sources.sh`, I get an error complaining it couldn't find xcbuild, that's not listed as a dependency in the [development instructions](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/dev-docs/development.md).  [xcbuild](https://github.com/facebookarchive/xcbuild) appears to be deprecated, and I was unsuccessful when trying to compile it from source. Do you think we could update the build script to make use of the more standard `xcodebuild` or could you provide instructions on how to install xcbuild?\n\n```\n⚙️  Generating plists...\n⚙️  Generating project...\n⚙️  Writing project...\nCreated project at /Users/thalesmello/src/AeroSpace/AeroSpace.xcodeproj\n⚙️  Generating plists...\n⚙️  Generating project...\n⚙️  Writing project...\nCreated project at /Users/thalesmello/src/AeroSpace/AeroSpace.xcodeproj\nerror: xcbuild executable at '/Library/Developer/SharedFrameworks/XCBuild.framework/Versions/A/Support/xcbuild' does not exist or is not executable\n```","files":null}]}
