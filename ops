I would like to have it simplified.\n\nI tried:\n```\naerospace focus --boundaries all-monitors-outer-frame --boundaries-action wrap-around-all-monitors left\n```\n\nbut it doesn't seem to work. I also checked the whole documentation but I couldn't find anything on this topic. Thanks in advance.","files":null}]}
