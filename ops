I never consciously enabled this and I was surprised to find that it was active. I noticed this first because when I pressed and held the Alt key, I noticed that there was a cross-shaped mouse cursor being used over certain UI elements. So I went into the system settings at accessibility/shortcuts and then I saw that the feature was active. \n\nThe screenshot shows all those checkboxes disabled, but when I first got into this dialog, they were all enabled.\n\n![2024-12-18-001441@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40255c3a-4d96-4c2f-9783-2da86008d6b6)\n\nI wonder if I accidentally pressed the keyboard shortcut at some point that's mentioned in the dialog -- I checked keyboard shortcuts in System Settings as well, and it was disabled so I'm not sure that can be the reason.\n\nHope this helps someone -- I haven't done all possible tests yet, but this is clearly a feature that could interfere with keyboard shortcuts, so I guess it can't hurt to mention it here.","files":null}]}
