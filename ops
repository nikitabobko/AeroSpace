I enable auto close on Photos.app\n\nThen after sending a message in iMessage, tabbing over to Safari and using the browser for 3 minutes, Photos.app closes. For some reason, this now causes iMessage to foreground.\n\nIt appears that the close event sent by Raycast to a background application is interpreted by aerospace as \"current app exited\" which causes the previously active window to become active.\n\nEvery time any app gets closed by Raycast (without being foregrounded, this doesn't happen if I don't run aerospace) I now need to cmd tab back to my active window.\n\nHappened twice while writing this issue, it happens every time.","files":null}]}
