So to test what Aerospace sees when you type an umlaut or any other letter, just change your keyboard layout to US in the macOS System Preferences and type anywhere. For me, when I now type an 'ü', it produces a '[' (which checks out with the physical location of the key if you google images of US keyboard layouts). So, to use an 'ü' in the Aerospace config, simply use the 'leftSquareBracket' shortcut that already exists. This should transfer to other non-US keyboards, I believe.\n\nLet me know if this works for you.","files":null}]}
