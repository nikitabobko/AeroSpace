There are quite special chars I need alt for and I don't enjoy having to do cramp inducing keyboard acrobatics to do window management.\n\nThis would be #VERY# important: In Germany eg. \"@\" is alt-L so the window-navigation fails. I could do right-alt-L to @ and left-alt-L to navigate.","files":null}]}
