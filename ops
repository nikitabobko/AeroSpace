I'll do so.\n\n\u003e 2. CleanMyMac is mostly bullshit, I would strongly recommend you get rid of it. I know this is beyond the scope but I can't help myself. More than once I've seen it cause damage to someone's machine, and the claims they make are nonsense IMO. You're better off learning how to clean your Mac yourself, and also learning how your Mac mostly cleans itself anyway.\n\nI try my best to keep my clean by myself, but I am not fully aware of good ways to do it. like deep cleaning and sorts since I can only delete files which I can keep track of. Do you mind sharing some ways on how to do so. Its offtopic aerospace, but it would be really nice to get to know this","files":null}]}
