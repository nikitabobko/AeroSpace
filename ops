And focusing windows \"in reverse order\" doesn't work because the API to focus windows doesn't always respect the order windows are focused in (it's flaky). The API to focus windows is probably the most buggiest and problematic API that AeroSpace uses.\n\nBut I think that this bug can be fixed by using a different visualization: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/24","files":null}]}
