I am not yet under sequoia, and won’t upgrade until I can « safely » use all my applications, including Raycast and Aerospace, and I have quite a few applications needing accessibility setting enabled. \n\nI've enabled back Logi Options+ and Raycast and no issues so far. Enabling Amazon Q did bring back the issue so I turned it back off, and I haven't felt like I'm missing anything else so far.","files":null}]}
