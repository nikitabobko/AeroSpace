What value does it bring? I don't see problems that people are asking questions in issues. If there is a question then there is always something to improve\n\u003e \n\u003e For example, your question about `alt` is not a question. It's an issue\n\u003e \n\u003e * I'm afraid that people will misuse Discussions\n\u003e * Two places to search for help/information is worse than one place\n\nMakes sense. I like discussions for some topics like discussing ideas or Q\u0026A. However, as you mentioned, a disadvantage of this approach is that you have then two sources of \"tickets\". If you prefer to stay with issues, it's not a problem either :).","files":null}]}
