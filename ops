That way you could place two virtual monitors on your physical monitor. You could cycle workspaces only on one of those virtual monitors\n\nI'm sure that's a huge amount of work, but virtual monitors would be AMAZING for ultrawide and super ultrawide monitors too. 32:9 or 32:10 is really nice because it's almost a dual screen setup with no bezel. Unfortuantely the window management is way worse than two physical displays. This would be completely solved by a good virtual monitor setup that could split it.","files":null}]}
