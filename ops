Right now, moving a window out of the container either literally moves the window out of the container or creates an implicit container. \n\nBut I suppose it indeed can be made configurable to wrap the movement when the movement is done in a direction that is parallel to the container's orientation (the movement would still \"move a window out of the container\" if the movement is done in a direction that is perpendicular to the container's orientation)\n\nI need more time to think about \"move wrapping\".
