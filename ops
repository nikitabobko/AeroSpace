Pretty neat. Thanks for attaching it here.\n\nNo problem! Glad you like it :). I didn't think about it at first neither, but because I'm also using AutoRaise (i.e. focus follows mouse) whenever I used that script to bring a floating window from another workspace, when I returned to the original workspace the mouse would be anywhere, so when I moved it I would lose the focus from the sticky window and lose it in the background. Luckily AeroSpace had that command available!\n\n\u003e Did you find a way to get the flickering (from workspace switching) to go away?\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean, if generic flickers of using AeroSpace (which I have, every now and then), or of the flickering that is generated by the script because of moving to the \"scratchpad workspace\" and then back. In the latter case, no, I wasn't able to fix it, but I know that it will be possible to fix it when #186 it's done, as it will be possible to bring windows by their id to the current workspace.\n\n\u003e Stellar work. I actually ended up moving over to yabai and giving up on aerospace. I found yabai to be much more customizable to my specific preferences. I have a really nice config working on yabai for my personal preferences.\n\nGreat to hear that you found a solution that works for you! Indeed what you list seems interesting. But my Linux laptop just broke, I was forced to steal my wife's mac (and lost two weeks adapting my workflow) so I can finish my neverending PhD... so I cannot waste time jumping to any other program anytime soon ðŸ˜….","files":null}]}
