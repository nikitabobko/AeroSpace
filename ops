One way of doing this could be to introduce `if.is-dialog`. The problem with this solution is that it is not \"enabled\" by default. Users would need to remember that they always need to write `if.is-dialog = false`\n2. Another crazy solution could be to introduce an option for `move-node-to-workspace` command `[--if-dialog [no]]`. And say that `--if-dialog no` is enabled by default in `on-window-detected` callback","files":null}]}
