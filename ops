The vision of AeroSpace as a \"ready-to-go\" solution, optimized for specific workflows with sensible defaults, definitely has its strengths. My only concern is the potential latency introduced when triggering external programs (which may then query properties, such as windows count, etc.), but without the actual measurements, I wouldn't worry too much.\n\n`on-window-detected` definitely has its conditional nature. I like the current approach, where you have bunch of rules in list, and the (first) matched rule(s) will be applied, it's not just one big if-else statement. In addition looping over those matchers is pretty fast.","files":null}]}
