I understand the difficulty presented by the way the system reports the tabs. But, the accordion solution is maybe a bit tedious. I often have a terminal window on the left of the screen and several tabbed pdfs on the right. If I understand correctly, I would have to join each new pdf to the other pdf windows and make sure that set is in accordion layout. But, then, the orientation of the accordion is not horizontal. Basically, the multiple steps required to arrange things compared with the system's method of automatically tabbing windows of the same application together is taxing. Is there a rule I could set that would automatically group windows of the same application in the same workspace?","files":null}]}
