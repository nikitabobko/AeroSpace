If AeroSpace manages to detect the crash then `Terminal.app` is opened with the crash log and the crash log is located in `/tmp/bobko.aerospace/runtime-error.txt`\n\nIn your case, it's probably a more severe crash. And AeroSpace couldn't detect it. You can find logs of severe crashes in `Console.app`","files":null}]}
