If the answer is yes then the following command could be used:\n\n```\nexec-and-forget [ $(aerospace list-windows --workspace focused --visible --count) -eq 1 ] \u0026\u0026 borders width=0.0 || borders width=6.0\n```\n\n\\\u003cnerd\u003eBTW https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2015 \\\u003c/nerd\u003e\n\nAlso see: #444","files":null}]}
