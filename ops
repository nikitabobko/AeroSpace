Therefor it can (especially when using `tiles`) get hardly possible to screen capture properly, since Kap is designed to overlay on top of all current windows and the user should define an area/window/fullscreen to capture.\nSo f.e. it can look something like this:\n![image](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/24993816/56d16c19-7e5f-4610-b6bc-fb8c1457bfed)\n\nWorkaround that work's for me: adding `[[on-window-detected]]` rule\n```toml\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.wulkano.kap'\nrun = 'layout floating'\n```\n\n- AeroSpace version: 0.8.2-Beta\n- macOS version: 14.2.1","files":null}]}
