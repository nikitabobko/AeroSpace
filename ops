For example, alt-T shows Telegram. \n\nI have configured Aerospace so that the windows of those apps always float.\n\nOn version 0.14.2 when I trigger the shortcut to show any of these apps:\n\n- they show where I last placed them on the screen\n- they show in the current workspace\n\nOn version 0.15.2, when I do the same:\n\n- they show on the bottom left corner of the screen\n- my workspace switches to the workpace they were first launched, instead of floating on the current workspace (this does not happen if I close the window instead of hiding it with the shortcut)\n\nI would like to preserve the behaviour Aerospace has on version 0.14.2, since it makes more sense for the use I give floating windows: they can be summoned on any workspace and appear where you place them.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\nI have not found any related issue.","files":null}]}
