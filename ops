I don't know if it's more of a OS thing\n\nI would also love that. Sometimes my floating windows are lost/hidden behind other windows.\n\n\u003e It would be useful to be able to set the accordion layout for some of the workspaces, either in a workspace config or in the window detected be able to check if startup and set the right workspace layout\n\nSame for me: ms teams is opening windows in new windows, which is a bit annoying. To solve that I would like to change to accordion layout for this workspace whenever teams is opened:\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.microsoft.teams2'\nrun = 'layout accordion'\n```\n\nJust in general: is there a reason why the actions that can be triggered by `on-window-detected` is so restricted?","files":null}]}
