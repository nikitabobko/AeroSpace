I can more clearly see this focus change thanks to `on-focus-changed = ['move-mouse window-lazy-center']`.\n\nI will attempt to reproduce on my personal machine and post a video. I am on a multi-monitor setup with macOS Sequoia 15.1 and AeroSpace v0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\nn/a","files":null}]}
