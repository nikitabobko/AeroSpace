I'll do so.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e 2. CleanMyMac is mostly bullshit, I would strongly recommend you get rid of it. I know this is beyond the scope but I can't help myself. More than once I've seen it cause damage to someone's machine, and the claims they make are nonsense IMO. You're better off learning how to clean your Mac yourself, and also learning how your Mac mostly cleans itself anyway.\n\u003e \n\u003e I try my best to keep my clean by myself, but I am not fully aware of good ways to do it. like deep cleaning and sorts since I can only delete files which I can keep track of. Do you mind sharing some ways on how to do so. Its offtopic aerospace, but it would be really nice to get to know this\n\nNo worries. It's mostly a misconception that you need to do anything. Keep your files/folders organized however makes sense to you - your Mac really doesn't care where you store things so you're free to come up with your own system. Keep what you want, delete what you don't. If you have a really complex set of files/folders and you need to de-dupe them, I used `fdupes` (if you're comfortable on the command-line); otherwise I've heard good things about `dupeguru` (https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net) and `diskdedupe` (https://diskdedupe.com).\n\nThe other thing to know is that when removing an app, mostly you can just drag the app bundle icon (which sits in /Applications) to the trash and call it a day. If you really want to fully remove it (usually not necessary), you can look in `~/Library/Application Support/`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, `/Library/LaunchAgents/`, `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` for any supporting files - don't remove anything if you're not sure what it is though. If you're not sure what those locations are or how to get to them, you can use Finder's Go menu -\u003e Go to Folder and type `~/Library` to open up your user's Library. Or `/Library` to open up the system Library, and navigate from there.\n\nBe careful not to touch anything in those folders without researching what it is and whether it's safe to delete.\nYour Mac is designed to be on most of the time - there are logs and things that get cleaned up and rotated at odd hours when nobody's using the machine - think past midnight - so if you have a habit of turning the machine off thinking you're doing the machine a favour, you're better off really just leaving it on and letting it sleep, it's designed for that.\n\nIf you need to keep your browser history cleared or cookies cleaned, the browsers have options for that at the end of your browsing session (as well as private or \"incognito\" browsing windows that do it automatically).\n\nLastly, and I can't stress this enough, most apps take up so little room that it's not worth any kind of deep cleaning. If you're worried about free space on your machine, you should pay attention to your photos, videos and audio. The system really keeps itself clean (and safe! Generally there's no need for any 3rd-party anti-virus or malware utilities.)\n\nIn short - your computer is like a car. Designed to be used, and while you should give it a superficial cleaning occasionally, becoming a mechanic is not required. And avoid buying products you don't need ;)","files":null}]}
