Right now I set the layout for wezterm to floating and I use a bash script that checks if wezterm is already open - if no, it opens in the active workspace and if yes, finds the window id, moves it to the active monitor and workspace and focuses it but it's kind of slow (2-3s). Is there a better way to do it currently?","files":null}]}
