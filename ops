So the hotkeys become the ones for that command, hence why the main mode bindings don't work.\n\nThis is unfortunately not what I am experiencing.  If that were the case, a restart of the application itself should fix it, but it doesn't.  I need to reboot my system entirely for it to work properly again.  The mode seems to be in normal mode when this happens.  The alt combinations just don't work (except for alt tab, which does work switching to the previous workspace).","files":null}]}
