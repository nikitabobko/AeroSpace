This also happens when I focus windows via `cmd+tab`, doing this without AeroSpace is instantaneous.\n\nI know it's still beta, but I wanted to ask:\n\n- Do other people experience this delay or am I missing some configuration\n- Is this a performance issue in AeroSpace or some inherent limitation of Accessibility API?\n- Is there any way to collect logs/diagnostics to find out more?\n\nI'm on M1 Pro + Sonoma.\n \n---\n\nI'm not trying to bash AeroSpace - the feature set is great and I use it as a daily driver, but the MacOS felt laggy for a while and now I found out it's only when using AeroSpace and I want to help to make it better.","files":null}]}
