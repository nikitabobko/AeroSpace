My natural monitor configuration is to have a the center monitor high, then others placed below the main on each side, this allows my to use the mouse and move naturally between screens.\n\nI have re-arranged my monitors so that hidden windows don't impact the other screens, now my habbits about moving the mouse means they run into walls rather than moving to the monitor.\n\nSomething like:\n```\n[corners]\nmain = ['top-right', 'top-left']\nsecondary = 'bottom-left'\n'^built-in retina display$' = ['top-left', 'bottom-right'] \n```","files":null}]}
