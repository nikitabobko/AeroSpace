I could live without minimizing/hiding though.\n\nI do see the value in preserving the window position in the layout. Perhaps windows in native fullscreen can be automatically made floating (and then toggled back when un-fullscreened), or moved to a hidden workspace (like the i3 scratchpad) and then moved back?","files":null}]}
