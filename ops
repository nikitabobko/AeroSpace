We would probably need to add `--workspace` and `--monitor` flags to the command to achieve this. It would be particularly useful if we could use `monitor.primary` (or similar) as a value for the monitor flag.\n\nMy current workflow for this is switching to the desired workspace and then moving it to the desired monitor with the current behaviour of `move-workspace-to-monitor`.","files":null}]}
