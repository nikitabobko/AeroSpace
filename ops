I encourage everyone to do the same and report back. Please follow https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/dev-docs/development.md for the project setup, you can use `install-from-sources.sh` script to install AeroSpace as `aerospace-dev` brew cask.\n\nI'm especially interested to see if something breaks if macOS goes to sleep, MacBook lid closes, screensaver activates, and you can add monitor configuration changes on top of it while everything mentioned is happening. These kind of circumstances.\n\nThe problem here is that when you lock the screen, go to sleep, etc. all windows are indistinguishable from closed, and AeroSpace has to restrain itself from destroying those windows if it detects sleep/locked_screen, detecting of which is itself turned out being fragile.","files":null}]}
