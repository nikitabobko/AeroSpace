Set the minimum size once and don't touch it anymore\n\nI have this especially with how I'm using Slack: I like to keep Slack in one Workspace together with a browser and I'm often shrinking Slack to have more space for the browser. Then when I do focus Slack I'd like it to grow bigger. I've just switched from Amethyst and that somehow supported this out-of-the-box and I noticed I'm missing this feature. I figured out I probably could emulate this with the hypotechical on-focus callback and `move` command.","files":null}]}
