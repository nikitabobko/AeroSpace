Could this be something within macOS?  I have attempted to look through fs_usage logs, as well as utilize tools such as Shortcut Detector to determine if anything was getting caught in between, but with no luck.  At some point, the alt combinations just fail to be caught by aerospace, even after a config reload, and complete stop and start of the application.  At that point, alt keys work regularly, in any application they are used in, providing the correct shortcuts for that particular application.  I have no other applications that claim the use of that key at a global level.","files":null}]}
