Unfortunately, Swift doesn't offer BST out of the box, so I indeed have to manually sort workspaces every time users asks next/prev, but I can implement BST myself if it becomes necessary.\n\n\u003e Querying an ordered list of names is what would be needed for the \"non-map\" case\n\nWhen I said \"communicating order back to the user\" I meant the status icon in the top right corner (it shows only currently focused workspace). It's no question that order is easily representable when you list all of the workspaces (e.g. scripts)\n\n\u003e it would be nice to be able to have keybindings that take me to a specific location in the workspace list\n\nIf we sticked to \"list paradigm\" that would probably be the solution, I agree.\n\n---\n\nSo far, I think that we are talking roughly about the same things. You can think of list of workspaces as about `Map\u003cInt, Workspace\u003e`. `Map\u003cString, Workspace\u003e` is just a list, indexed by strings rather than ints. \n\nOne of strengths of your model that it's easier to understand, since there are fewer concepts, but once you introduce int index, our models start having the same number of concepts.\n\nI see only two differences between our models:\n1. Implementation performance. If we consider \"name-based\" as the primary way of navigation then `Map\u003cString, Workspace` is preferred (I designed the workspace navigation as such, I personally don't use next/prev); otherwise, \"list paradigm\" is preferred\n2. In my model, workspace string representation always starts with index/name/identifier in the status icon (which I think is a good thing). In your model, it becomes user's responsibility to keep order and string representation in sync (if users even care about this mapping)\n\nMaybe my model would be easier to understand if I renamed \"name\" to \"id\"/\"index\"","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1724609315,"nonce":"3+6/Wn2ZnE/YYlVAsdXOZHjebhg=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6Jn7Vj","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/310#issuecomment-2308945251"},"message":"Closing in favor of #245","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1724609315,"nonce":"Nah1HcbC8rkk5S+/MKnbcjN9sB0=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6OThemzwAAAANCwtF_"},"status":2}]}
