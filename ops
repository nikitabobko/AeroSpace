What workflow do you find this command useful for?\n\nMy use case: I often don't want to use workspaces when I don't have any external monitors (normally have three). When I use the dock (or cmd-tab) to switch between apps, the workspace changes automatically, but I can't easily cycle between apps using the focus bindings, I have to remember which workspace I previously had the app/window.
