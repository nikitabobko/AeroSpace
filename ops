I landed here after checking all intelliJ keybindings for option-3/4). Particularly confusing when there's a floating settings menu open in one, but trying to open settings from the other workspace feels like a no-op (cause it's opening in the other WS). Now that I know, will report back here in a week or so if still feels buggy. May just be something we need to document, for now (though the floating window behavior could maybe be made more intuitive)","files":null}]}
