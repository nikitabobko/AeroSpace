I have been trying to keep a window on all workspaces, but this does not seems to be possible.\n\nI have tried with:\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\n...\nrun = ['move-node-to-workspace $AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE']\n```\n\nbut it isn't supported (I think `move-node-to-workspace` expects a literal workspace here, and the variable might not event be set outside of the `workspace-changed` event).\n\nI though of moving the window when the workspace changes, but aerospace does not have commands to act on arbitrary windows (only on focused ones)\n\nAm I missing something?","files":null}]}
