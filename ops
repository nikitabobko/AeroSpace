Is it possible that these aren't treated as dialogs?\n\n**Reproduction (without need for external monitor):**\n\n1. Add this rule to .aerospace.toml:\n```toml\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.jetbrains.intellij'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'\n```\n2. Open IDEA\n3. Move IDEA to workspace 1\n4. Open Settings from by clicking `Intellij IDEA -\u003e Settings` in main panel\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nSettings dialog is opened on workspace 1\n\n**Current behavior:**\nSettings dialog is opened on workspace 2 and workspace 2 is opened as current workspace","files":null}]}
