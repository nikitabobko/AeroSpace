Aerospace and qutebrowser go into a weird behavior if there is a configuration error in qutebrowser. On startup there is a popup that can be dismissed, but afterwards qutebrowser fails to get focus or render above other windows in a stack when it is navigated to with aerospace. When the config is resolved and qutebrowser starts up normally everything returns to working as normal.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\nGeneral qutebrowser tom-foolery, nothing specifically like this though.","files":null}]}
