There's no easy way of specifying this behaviour at the moment. My current suggestion I've proposed is to effectively attach a window identifier and then filter them inside of various other apps (including AeroSpace) for more specific functionality. In the case of ghostty, it would simply float the Quick Terminal window despite belonging to the `com.mitchellh.ghostty` app id.\n\nI'm going to be putting up a pull request as a draft soon that has this implemented and I'll link it here in a bit\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
