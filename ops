I need to add it to the docs\n\nThat's why here: `cmd-ctrl-k = 'exec-and-forget open -a \\\"Microsoft Edge\\\"'`. You don't need to escape quotation. The right syntax would be `cmd-ctrl-k = 'exec-and-forget open -a \"Microsoft Edge\"'`\n\n\u003e A question, after fullscreen a window, If I switch with focus, then it will be \"de-fullscreened\". Is this a designed behavior?\n\nYes, it's a designed behavior. Why asking?\n\n---\n\nI just tried `cmd-ctrl-j = 'exec-and-forget open -a iTerm'` and it works as expected. I'm not sure what the problem could be on your machine","files":null}]}
