I think i might have a related issue:\n\nOn WS1 i have 3 floating applications: Safari, Finder \u0026 iina, Safari is the furthest in the background, then Finder ontop of Safari, then, when i open a movie from finder and iina opens, when i cmd-w iina, instead of focusing Finder which was the most recent application used, it switches to Safari and put it in the foreground even though it was last in the hierarchy, so i have to manually focus Finder again to put it infront of Safari\n\nIf i close Safari, then open a movie from Finder that opens in iina, when i cmd-w iina it does switch to Finder BUT also switches to the first (left most) tab in Finder, so then i have to manually go to the tab in Finder that i had open\n\nOverall, there seem to be huge Focus issues in Aerospace currently\n\nmacOS Ventura 13.7.1\nAeroSpace v0.15.2","files":null}]}
