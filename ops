It seems what happens to me is that\n\n1. One workspace (A) containing one or more Chrome windows is on my (one and only) external display, visible, but none of the windows is active (i.e. their window control buttons are all gray; this seems to be necessary) \n2. Another workspace (B) on the same external display is hidden, i.e. all of its windows are stashed at the corner of **the main display**.\n3. Under certain condition that I haven't completely figured out, when switching to workspace B (either via Aerospace hotkey, or activating one of its Chrome windows with `⌘-Tab` or Mission Control),\n   1. The focus first goes to a Chrome window in B (i.e. it becomes an active window, with colored window control buttons), and all windows in B are moved to the external display, in the mean time all windows in A are moved to the corner of the main display\n   2. Right after that, mysteriously, a window in A gets activated (its window control buttons get colored), and workspace A is also activated and moved back to the external display, and B again stashed to the corner of the main display. I'm guessing that the weird re-focus to a window in A is due to Chrome. Now workspace A takes the external display.\n   3. Instantly, a window in B gets (mysteriously) activated, and brings B to the external display and puts A windows away\n   4. The back-and-forth switch loop keeps on\n\nMore notes:\n1. The loop is not always self-sustainable, in rare cases, things stabilize after several flickers\n2. A strange Chrome window (re-)focus behavior that might be relevant: If there is a Chrome window in a third workspace (C), and the workspace configuration is\n   * A: assigned to external display; all windows are not active, but visible on the external display\n   * B: assigned to external display; all windows are not active, and are on the corner of the main display\n   * C: assigned to main display; a Chrome window is active, let's call it window γ\n\n   Now if I\n   1. First switch to some other non-Chrome window (say a Finder window) in C\n   2. Then activate to workspace B\n\n   Workspace B is successfully put to the external display, but all of its windows are not active (control buttons grayed out). The active window, surprisingly, becomes the window γ, and not the Finder window.","files":null}]}
