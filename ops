It's not a bug\n\nWouldn't it be possible to hide applications that aren't part of the current workspace? This is how the [FlashSpace](https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/FlashSpace) project manages manages its spaces. While it is only possible to hide applications (and not individual windows), Aerospace could still use this to hide applications that don't have any windows in the current workspace to reduce resource usage.","files":null}]}
