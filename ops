My normal behaviour is to have shortcuts for my most important applications like browser, terminal, chat, ... and to switch directly to that window.\n\nI handled this in the past with the Hammerspoon launch or focus API https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.application.html and with yabai/skhd it was possible to query yabai with json output and to wrap some actions into a script triggered by skhd.\n\nIt would be great to have a subcmd in aerospace to focus an application with a given id.\n\nThanks in advance.","files":null}]}
