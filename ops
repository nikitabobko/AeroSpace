Particularly, I am interested in being able to list floating windows... in that case, it would be trivial (as a user) to implement the requested feature\n```\n(i.e., a scratchpad).\n\n\nBy the way, many thanks for the app. It's a great tool for those used to i3 on Linux, and it's a comfort being able to keep a similar workflow when changing environment so drastically. \n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I should add. Thanks once again!","files":null}]}
