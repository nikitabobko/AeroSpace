This happens both when I've got my macbook plugged into an external monitor and when I'm only using the built-in laptop display. \n\nWhen quitting Aerospace and playing the presentation, everything works as expected.\n\nHere's a video I made of the issue. First, I show that playing the presentation (in an empty workspace that only has keynote) works as expected. I then hit esc to exit out. Then, i open a terminal in that workspace, and play the presentation again. The presentation is automatically minimized, and any attempts to open it from the dock just re-minimize it. The only way to get out of this state is to either hit esc as soon as you un-minimize the presentation (which I did in the video below), or quitting keynote from the dock.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc81e82-e907-465c-9110-397d2c49dac7\n\n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\nI wasn't able to find anything about this, so perhaps this is an issue on my side. I'd really appreciate if anyone can let me know if this works for them.","files":null}]}
