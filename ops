Indeed for a lot of system shortcuts, only fn from Apple keyboards are recognised. However, Karabiner has supported mapping any key to fn with support for all the new window layout shortcuts. I believe this is done by using the Apple vendor ID with their virtual keyboard device.\n\nI’ve mapped a spare key to Apple fn on my keyboard. And I’d really like to be able to use that as my main modifier for all window management needs since I know it won’t conflict with any third party app.","files":null}]}
