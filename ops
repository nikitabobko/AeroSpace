And as others have mentioned creates a rather jarring experience. \n\nBeing able to define zones means you can take control of large monitor estate and lock applications down based on those widescreen requirements, its sooo nearly there as i can transition my workspaces on docking my laptop to the new display automatically and keep some on the mac screen (which is just amazing!). \n\nCurrently If i have e.g. 1 Browser session open on a workspace, when that moves to a widescreen it takes up the entire 5120x1440 estate which just makes it pointless, the only way to take control of this app window is to essentially open multiple other applications.  It would be nice to just have a \"chill window\" as per https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/60#issue-2044997998 where you have a centrally located browser window and nothing else around it to read some blogs etc. \n\nAlso - great work @nikitabobko  I was about to throw my mac away as I was sick of dragging windows for a living in OSx!!","files":null}]}
