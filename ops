For example - on an empty desktop, opening a sheet in Numbers will correctly fill the entire screen. But opening a new document in a new tab will cause the application to take up only half of the screen.\n\nHere is screen recording with the bug:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/152cc003-86d0-461e-88ca-8bf1d2a42fc3","files":null}]}
