Here is a quick screencast:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d5a077-33b2-46b6-9ae7-23b3053bd19d\n\nI wonder if this is actually on purpose that the resize command won't work for floating windows? If that is is there a way I can resize the floating window with keybindings? \n\nAlso is it possible to move the floating window up, down, left and right on screen with keybindings? \n\nIs there a way to config as: when I trigger a window to float, I can config it to display in the middle of the screen with a specific width and height? \n\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
