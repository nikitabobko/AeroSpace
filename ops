The method for assigning these indices is flexible, but one approach could be to start from the top-left corner as index 1 and proceed in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order, similar to reading a book. Implementing this feature would allow users to consistently switch to a specific window without needing to consider the current focused window's position relative to the desired window.\n\nFor an accordion layout, the index could initially be determined by the order in which windows first appear in the workspace. However, it would be even more user-friendly if users could set the index for each window themselves and have the option to change it using keybinds\n\nI hope this makes sense, and thank you for the amazing work!","files":null}]}
