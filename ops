I want to have to only look for where it is, fling my mouse over there and start going. It's ridiculous how often I send a mistaken slack message whose content is `ghci` instead of running it because i forgot to click on the new window which i obviously want to focus immediately after creating (i tried to hack around this using `list-windows` and matching on any newly created window in on-window-detected, but because there's no metadata to the windows regarding which was most recently created, this is impossible).","files":null}]}
