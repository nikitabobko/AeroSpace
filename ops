All windows without a fullscreen button are floated by default (except for some hardcoded exceptions). Steam shows a maximize button instead of a fullscreen button.\n\n\u003e except for some hardcoded exceptions\n\nActually, Steam was part of these hardcoded exceptions. AeroSpace specifically tiled windows with `com.valvesoftware.steam` bundle ID https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/a20ea2b4578c385a2774cc56360578e049372dce/Sources/AppBundle/tree/MacWindow.swift#L217\n\nI rechecked Steam app and I see that they changed bundled ID to `com.valvesoftware.steam.helper`\n\nI have two things to say:\n1. It makes me sad applications as big as Steam just change their bundle ID. It's not the way developers are supposed to use bundle ID :(\n2. I think I would like to keep Steam floating and I will remove the hardcoded outdated Steam bundle ID. Steam tends to show these stupid \"special offers\" dialogs on startup which would normally get detected as dialogs only because they don't have a fullscreen button. But hardcoding Steam bundle ID will make \"special offers\" dialogs tiling","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1711661668,"nonce":"hzYGbYPBprbniOahzkC3MMpzAcs=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM54xOe8","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/193#issuecomment-2026170300"},"message":"\u003e you can make it tiled by running layout tiling command\n\nIf you want to tile Steam windows by default you can use `on-window-detected` callback\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.valvesoftware.steam.helper'\nrun = 'layout tiling'\n```","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1716301628,"nonce":"EwiN1qcfTItPlQ8qeyQSP/Gp3VM=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6D9elDzwAAAAL_xe1T"},"status":2}]}
