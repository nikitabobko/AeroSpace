I can't fullscreen it with shortcuts, as well as move it to one side of the screen with an other application on the other side - firefox will just float over the other window, which will be fullscreen. It's like firefox isn't recognized as a window by aerospace and therfore nothing effects it.\n**Related issues you could find**\nPlease make sure to search for duplicates.\nIf you couldn't find the duplicates, linking related issues is helpful anyway.","files":null}]}
