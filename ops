Alternatively, you can just the `accordion` layout\n\nI understand and honestly that has been my go to workaround but I believe there is one limitation since the behaviour is different as is a layout change and not a toggle just like the regular `fullscreen` or `macos-native-fullscreen`\n\nTo clarify, with 3 windows (where the windows 2 and 3 are in a container, like the example), just changing to accordion can simulate a fullscreen of the container well enough and change back to tile when no longer needed it kinda works, even though I feels off because its not a toggle like the `fullscreen`.\nMeaning that I would not have the ability of pressing the same key to toggle that fake fullscreen.","files":null}]}
