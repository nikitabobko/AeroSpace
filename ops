This is how my xmonad is currently setup. \n\nCurrent behavior: the other monitor will become focused. If we are at [0,1*], it becomes [0*, 1]\nDesired behavior: the two workspaces will be swapped. If it was [0,1*] before, it would be [1, 0*]. \n\nI have modified the source to accomplish this for myself, but would appreciate it being included in your source for future releases. Thank you! \n\n## Checklist\n\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
