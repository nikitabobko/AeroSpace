Then I switch back to split vertical and it goes back up. If I trigger split horizontally and then close the window to the right and re-open it again, window gets correctly positioned from top to bottom. If I open another, it also correctly splits horizontally. But if I were to open a new window when the previous one is \"pushed\" down, the second window will also appear \"pushed\" down.  \n\nhttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/1446529/1c6057df-080f-4ee4-b40a-6e5a29428e47","files":null}]}
