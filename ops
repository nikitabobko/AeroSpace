I don't have it bound or created in the config, and I have alt-r bound to resize in the config.\n\nI'm not sure if it's PEBCAK but I've tried re-ordering things and it's still doing the same thing.\nI started with the i3 config and made a few modifications. Any ideas what the issue could be? If I press another key like alt-n, it moves to an 'n' workspace too. \n\nAny help would be appreciated :) I'll also update this if I find the solution. Also, this is a seriously good wm, I've tried others on os x and I've never been able to have a workflow similar to with i3 until now.\n\nHere is my config:\n```\n# Reference: https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/etc/config\n\nenable-normalization-flatten-containers = false\nenable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = false\nstart-at-login = true\n\n[mode.main.binding]\nalt-enter = 'exec-and-forget open -n /System/Applications/kitty.app'\n\nalt-shift-c = 'reload-config'\n\nalt-r = 'mode resize'\n\n# See: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/docs/commands.md#move-workspace-to-monitor\nalt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor next'\n\nalt-h = 'focus left'\nalt-j = 'focus down'\nalt-k = 'focus up'\nalt-l = 'focus right'\n\nalt-shift-h = 'move-through left'\nalt-shift-j = 'move-through down'\nalt-shift-k = 'move-through up'\nalt-shift-l = 'move-through right'\n\nalt-x = 'split horizontal'\nalt-v = 'split vertical'\n\nalt-f = 'fullscreen'\n\nalt-s = 'layout v_accordion' # 'layout stacking' in i3\nalt-w = 'layout h_accordion' # 'layout tabbed' in i3\nalt-e = 'layout tiles horizontal vertical' # 'layout toggle split' in i3\n\nalt-shift-space = 'layout floating tiling' # 'floating toggle' in i3\n\n# Not supported, because this command is redundant in AeroSpace mental model.\n# See: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/docs/guide.md#floating-windows\n#alt-space = 'focus toggle_tiling_floating'\n\n# `focus parent`/`focus child` are not yet supported, and it's not clear whether they should be supported at all\n# https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/5\n# alt-a = 'focus parent'\n\nalt-1 = 'workspace 1'\nalt-2 = 'workspace 2'\nalt-3 = 'workspace 3'\nalt-4 = 'workspace 4'\nalt-5 = 'workspace 5'\nalt-6 = 'workspace 6'\nalt-7 = 'workspace 7'\nalt-8 = 'workspace 8'\nalt-9 = 'workspace 9'\nalt-0 = 'workspace 10'\nalt-f1 = 'workspace 11'\nalt-f2 = 'workspace 12'\nalt-f3 = 'workspace 13'\nalt-f4 = 'workspace 14'\n\nalt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'\nalt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'\nalt-shift-3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 3'\nalt-shift-4 = 'move-node-to-workspace 4'\nalt-shift-5 = 'move-node-to-workspace 5'\nalt-shift-6 = 'move-node-to-workspace 6'\nalt-shift-7 = 'move-node-to-workspace 7'\nalt-shift-8 = 'move-node-to-workspace 8'\nalt-shift-9 = 'move-node-to-workspace 9'\nalt-shift-0 = 'move-node-to-workspace 10'\nalt-shift-f1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 11'\nalt-shift-f2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 12'\nalt-shift-f3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 13'\nalt-shift-f4 = 'move-node-to-workspace 14'\n\n[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]\n1 = 2\n2 = 2\n3 = 2\n4 = 2\n5 = 1\n6 = 1\n7 = 1\n8 = 1\n9 = 1\n0 = 1\n11 = 2\n12 = 2\n13 = 2\n14 = 2\n\n[mode.resize.binding]\nh = 'resize width -50'\nj = 'resize height +50'\nk = 'resize height -50'\nl = 'resize width +50'\nenter = 'mode main'\nesc = 'mode esc'\n```","files":null}]}
