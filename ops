I have an issue with this; was wondering if you have a workaround (or maybe you don't face that issue).\n\nI'm using it to \"toggle\" my WezTerm terminal (right now, I'm doing things in Hammerspoon, which involves adjust the size of the window as well)\n\nWith this script, whenever I choose to \"show\" the window, seems like AeroSpace first tries to fit it in the layout and then realizes I've set it to be floating, but the size stays as it was when AeroSpace tried to fit it in the layout.","files":null}]}
