So it would be useful to have a command like `aerospace force-window-detected` to run all the rules the move the windows back to their original workspace.\n\nAlso a different request question, it's possible to assign layouts to workspaces in the config file? e.g `workspace 1` to start with the `h_accordion` layout.","files":null}]}
