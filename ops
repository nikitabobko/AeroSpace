And I think for focusing an empty workspace, I could try to manually focus that workspace as a workaround. \n\nSo what about the bug I brought up initially? I find that, when I moved one window to another monitor, if the focus still remains on the original monitor, I cannot do anything with that window (e.g. move that window back, resize). Is that also somewhat \"by design\" or a real bug?","files":null}]}
