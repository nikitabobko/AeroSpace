I tested by starting graphically intensive processes (tested with video-playing Firefox and VLC) either on a separate non-visible AeroSpace workspace or a separate macOS Space, and then looking at the CPU usage in htop.\n\nThe CPU usage is always significantly lower when the GPU heavy application runs in the background of a macOS space instead of a AeroSpace workspace (in my testing as high as 0.2% vs 8%).\n\nNot sure how fixable it is, since it seems macOS rendering optimization might rely heavily on macOS Spaces.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\nRelated to #128. I tried with the [same GPU stress test](https://www.matthew-x83.com/online/gpu-test.php) they linked and could reproduce my findings above.","files":null}]}
