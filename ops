This is something that I'm really missing.\n\nCurrently, aerospace only knows about absolute values.\nE.g., if you have to windows and increase one window's size so that you have your ration (say 2:1), then it only works on this monitor.\nIf i swap the workspace to another monitor (e.g, internal LCD), the ration looks totally different due to the absolute values do note represent a usefull ration on this screen.\n\nI'd really love to have this feature!","files":null}]}
