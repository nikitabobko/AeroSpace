It would be nice to be able to configure and group workspaces together into a \"workspace set\" so you can switch from one set to another.\n2. More immediately as a short-term fix, be able to pass in multiple workspace #s to the aerospace workspace command.\n3. Perhaps more long term, be able to issue multiple commands to aerospace or take in a file as an input where you could issue a command per line.","files":null}]}
