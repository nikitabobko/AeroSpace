The usual way to do it is to drag the tab and drop it in the window where you want the tab to go. However, with Aerospace as soon you deattach the tab from the window Chrome makes a separate window and Aersopace tries to align it.  I wanted to know what can be done to make merging Chrome tabs easier with Aerospace. Possibly ignore the window that being dragged? \n\nP.S. There are no problems with Firefox because it doesn't create a window when trying to move the tab.","files":null}]}
