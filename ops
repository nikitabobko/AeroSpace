I see the expected behavior when other apps (e.g., my web browser or slack) have focus. Could kitty have some weird property where it's \"greedy\" for focus?\n\nIf it's relevant, in my setup, kitty is also started by aerospace using the following config:\n\n```toml\nalt-shift-enter = 'exec-and-forget cd; /Applications/kitty.app/Contents/MacOS/kitty --single-instance'\n```\n\nNB this isn't breaking anything for me right now, I just noticed it while experimenting, but I could imagine some setup where it becomes a blocker.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1732532055,"nonce":"5PqoUqp0Pd+YW0LNPbshzbfHS44=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6gWnhJzwAAAAOXBiHj"},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]}]}
