Alternatively this can be accomplished by some monitor conditions for window callbacks (so I can automatically assign IDEA to different workspace e.g. when monitor resolution matches the one of the external monitor, but I still think that opening dialogs on same workspace may be useful (I sometimes move windows to different workspaces) ðŸ¤”","files":null}]}
