Whenever I've seen a \"vibrating\" window, it's because the app and Aerospace are competing to place the window in a specific spot. Setting the window to float by default in your aerospace config file may take care of the issue.\n\n2. CleanMyMac is mostly bullshit, I would strongly recommend you get rid of it. I know this is beyond the scope but I can't help myself. More than once I've seen it cause damage to someone's machine, and the claims they make are nonsense IMO. You're better off learning how to clean your Mac yourself, and also learning how your Mac mostly cleans itself anyway.","files":null}]}
