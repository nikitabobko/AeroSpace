To ensure it wasn't some chrome config, I used two incognito windows this AM.\n- Place Chrome instance #1 on workspace A\n- Place Chrome instance #2 on workspace B\n\n- Switch back and forth between the workspaces\n\nFor me, within a few switches, a \"workspace switching loop\" will initiate.\nBy this, I mean:\n\nAerospace will automatically switch from workspace A =\u003e workspace B =\u003e workspace A =\u003e workspace B and so on.\nIn a rapid, flicker pattern.\n\n**Other notes:**\n\nTo end the behavior, I usually just send command for the target workspace repetitively.\nThis tends to break the loop.\n\n------------\n\nLet me know if you need anything else --\nThanks for AeroSpace!","files":null}]}
