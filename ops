After I launch Emacs, the window only have half screen. `aerospace list-windows --workspace visible` shows there are two windows with name 'Emacs', but only one has title. \n\nI tried to focus the window which doesn't have title, but it says can't find that window, while focusing the one which has title works fine. And that window doesn't exit even I closed Emacs.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"381\" alt=\"图片\" src=\"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/41909950/85159a7c-a2cb-4b49-a11c-b3fd82f15fe2\"\u003e\n\n\u003cimg width=\"392\" alt=\"图片\" src=\"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/41909950/9e1d4cc4-2549-45a4-ad76-b20fd02949ae\"\u003e\n\nand because I can't focus the window, I can't use `aerospace close` to close it.
