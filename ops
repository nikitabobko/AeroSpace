Examples include windows opened with \n```\nmpv --no-native-fs some_video_file\n``` \nand\n```\nqlmanage -p some_photo\n``` \n\nI encountered this problem when running these commands from the terminal (kitty). Instead of the MPV player or the preview pane being focused, the terminal window is focused, blocking the player and the preview pane. A cmd + tab can bring the focus back to the desired window, but this does not seem to be the desired behaviour.\n\nCan this issue be resolved with proper configurations or will it need a more complex solution?","files":null}]}
