If lucky then there would be a parser error. Otherwise nothing but silent fail.\n\nI'd be happy if you could provide a reproducer. Normally, if something fails during config parsing, a terminal should open up with the error message:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"682\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/20517828/9eb25583-d1e8-4c71-8b79-99b352aa2080\"\u003e\n\n\u003e Relaunching causes quite a bit of mess\n\nWell, yes. Right now, AeroSpace doesn't preserve the layout during relaunch. Please open an issue, if you think that's a problem. Normally, you shouldn't be relaunching the AeroSpace\n\n\u003e alt-0 sometime refuses to go to workspace 0. I'd say 3 out of 5 times. I have to use the menubar to go there -- sometime even that does not work (then I click on the app that I know is in space 0 on the dock)\n\nThat's weird. Is it specifically about workspace 0? Can you please rename the workspace 0 and see if the problem happens with the new lexically smallest workspace?\n\nAre you sure that you don't have any other app that intercepts alt-0 shortcut?\n\n\u003e docs mention v0.6 (e.g callback), but I could not find that version on the release page.\n\n0.6.0-Beta version is in development.
