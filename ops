I have it configured that way so that for instance:\n- If I have only a single window open it is centered and at a specific size\n- Two windows take up more space overall but still don't quite expand to fill the whole screen\n- Three or more windows are large enough that the behaviour becomes more like the default (i.e. screen is filled)\n\nAnd part of my use case for this is actually for Screen sharing purposes - my colleagues don't have Ultrawide monitors so if I share my entire screen the text for them is tiny, so what I prefer to do is use Zoom's \"Share a region of the screen\" and I set that region right over the \"one window\" size.\n\nI could tell the screen sharing to share a window rather than the screen, but if I do that then I can't switch application on the share easily.  Using the region based share I can move between workspaces to show other single-window applications","files":null}]}
