The application in question is Firefox.  I need to have two separate profiles running at the same time, one for hardened browsing, other for Zoom.  Using `cp -r` I ended up with `/Applications/Firefox.app` and `/Applications/Firefox for Zoom.app`.  It works fine it seems.\n\nHowever when I want to place one firefox on workspace 2, and other on workspace 4, I am unsure how to currently do it.  Both have the same application id, so `if.app-id` cannot be used.  Matching on window title will not work either, since the title differs based on the active tabs.\n\nThe solution for me would be to introduce new condition, for example `if.app-path-prefix`, so I could do\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-path-prefix = '/Applications/Firefox.app/'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'\n\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-path-prefix = '/Applications/Firefox for Zoom.app/'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace 4'\n```\n\nThank you for considering this feature.\n\n(As off-topic note at the end, thank you, AeroSpace is great.  When I was forced to switch to Mac few days back, the usability was horrible.  Then I installed AeroSpace, ported over my i3 config, and suddenly I no longer want to shoot my brain out.  So, thanks a lot.)","files":null}]}
