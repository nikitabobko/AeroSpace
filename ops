This happens most often on floating windows.\n\nSorry, I don't understand what the problem is here. When you ALT+TAB to a window, the workspace this window belongs to is activated, meaning that all windows from the workspace become \"visible\". Why does it cause problems that make you disable AeroSpace?\n\n\u003e It would be great if there was a way of telling which workspace an application has a window on, like in the list of workspaces in the menu bar.\n\nRight now, AeroSpace shows monitor name next to all non-empty workspaces. I plan to show app names there. Would it fix your problem?","files":null}]}
