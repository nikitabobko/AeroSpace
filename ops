I really would like to be able to unset keys, or at least have them pass through to the system. I use colemak and type in norwegian. So to type \"å\" I use ⌥a, to type \"ø\" I use ⌥o, and to type \"æ\" I use ⌥'. That last one works, but the former two do not.\n\nThe work around is simple enough. I created an \"empty\" mode, such that when I'm typing prose I can switch to that, but this isn't very ergonomic to require that switch.\n\n```toml\nalt-x = 'mode empty'\n\n[mode.empty.binding]\nesc = 'mode main'\n```\n\nSo I guess this is a feature request to unset keys entirely.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1718967133,"nonce":"p98izB60b0N5fHU8MZg5cU7T3tU=","metadata":{"github-id":"REE_lADOJl1IZM6M5qI7zwAAAAMVObHG"},"status":1}]}
