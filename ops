I go to fullscreen (not native) with one of them.\nWhen I change the focus to other window (be it alt-hjkl or cmd+`), it pops out of fullscreen to whatever layout I have.\n\nIs it possible to be in fullscreen mode all the time and switch between windows without exiting it?\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
