It sometimes happens to me that aerospace thinks that window is still present despite the application being closed.\n\n`list-apps` *does not* show the application, but `list-windows` *does* show the window.  When I modify the format for `list-windows` to include a process id, I can see that there is *no process with such PID*.  Hence I believe the window in question just someone got stuck when I closed the application.\n\nRight now I solve this by restarting aerospace, but that is somewhat clunky.  Would be nice to be able just run something like `aerospace forget-window WIN_ID` instead.\n\nI tried `aerospace close-all-windows-but-current` and am told `Can't close 'Emacs' window. Probably the window doesn't have a close button`.  But even if that worked, sometimes I do not want to close all windows :)\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
