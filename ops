With what you describe, it's easy to hide a window but getting it back to the original workspace takes several steps.\n\nI guess one could set up specific commands for specific applications but it seems harder to just get any window back to the workspace. That's where I feel filling up the space taken up an application if it gets hidden and adding it back to the workspace if it is selected again, would make things easier.","files":null}]}
