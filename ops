You can currently do this with Sketchybar's `alias` command, but it refreshes using a timer. It would be really nice if I could get this info on an event-driven basis.\n\nIf AeroSpace had some sort of callback that fires when changing bindings, that would solve my problem! Even better if the current binding was also in the environment so I could pass that along too.\n\nI think this would be useful for anyone building a GUI around AeroSpace.\n\nThank you!\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
