The issue was reported to be solved in the latest version of Aerospace at the time (June 26).\n\nI must have started using Aerospace after that time because I am also in MacOS Sequoia and I have been enjoying Aerospace since my first experience up until yesterday. It appears that my `alt` modifier stops working in Aerospace after my MacBook Pro's auto update last night where my system updates to the latest MacOS Sequoia 15 Developer Beta(24B5035e).\n\n\n\nI have made sure the following few things:\n\n- updating Aerospace to version `0.14.2-Beta` and restarting the app but the problem still presists\n- change `alt` to say `cmd` in Aerospace config and it works fine\n- use Aerospace from command line, tested a couple of basic commands and it works fine\n- my `alt` key is not broken, e.g., I can switch between MacOS desktops with `alt-left` and `alt-right`\n\nChanging `alt` to `cmd` has too many conflicts in key bindings than I am willing to deal with and `ctrl` is just like way in the corner and I need to build up muscle memory all over again. Therefore, I really hope I can identify the problem and fix it here. Appreciate any help/advice in advance.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e Here's my full Aerospace config...\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n```\n# Place a copy of this config to ~/.aerospace.toml\n# After that, you can edit ~/.aerospace.toml to your liking\n\n# It's not necessary to copy all keys to your config.\n# If the key is missing in your config, \"default-config.toml\" will serve as a fallback\n\n# You can use it to add commands that run after login to macOS user session.\n# 'start-at-login' needs to be 'true' for 'after-login-command' to work\n# Available commands: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands\nafter-login-command = []\n\n# You can use it to add commands that run after AeroSpace startup.\n# 'after-startup-command' is run after 'after-login-command'\n# Available commands : https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands\nafter-startup-command = []\n\n# Start AeroSpace at login\nstart-at-login = true\n\n# Normalizations.
