I just started configuring today, so this could very well be user error, but I've set up a shortcut to do `move-node-to-monitor prev` and `move-node-to-monitor next`.\n\nIt works great to move the node, however, after the node moves, I would've expected to keep focus on that node, but instead it seems like the focus moves to another node on the previous monitor.","files":null}]}
