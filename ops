However I'm having an issue with the spaces getting swapped because my secondary display is position on the left. Secondary is assigned 1, primary is assigned 2. If I swap the virtual location to the right of the primary it behaves as intended. Is there an easy way to flip the number assignment to right to left vs left to right in the toml file?","files":null}]}
