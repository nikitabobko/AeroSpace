I've been wondering if Chrome has some \"hold on to focus\" effect?\n\n`Do workspaces A and B must be on different monitors?`\n- Nope. I must have \u003e 1 monitor. But workspaces A and B themelves can be on the same monitor - or on two distinct monitors. \n\n`You use workspace-back-and-forth command to switch between workspaces, right?`\n- I'm using simple `workspace` commands, e.g., I press `alt-u` to trigger the `workspace u` command stored in my config as `alt-u = 'workspace U'`\n\n`I even tried this script to emulate quick initial workspace switches:`\n- Speed of switching doesn't seem to be causal. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nA bit more context from re-inducing the problem just now:\nI'm using `JankyBorders`.\n\n- May require a full 3 monitors (@adamdottv, @LeandroLovisolo -- please report your # of monitors // if you can repro on only 2)\n- I have one Chrome window on `workspace u`. \n- Second Chrome on `workspace t`.\n- The very-first-time I navigate from `workspace u` to `workspace t` by pushing `alt-u`, the Chrome window on `workspace u` is shown. However, it lacks the blue (active window) padding from `JankyBorders`.\n\nIn other words, on the-very-first-switch to a chrome window, it is (perhaps) never fully focus'd.\n\nThen: \non the switch to the other chrome window via `alt-t`, \nthe flickering ensues.","files":null}]}
