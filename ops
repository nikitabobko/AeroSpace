In an editor, if I press \u003ckbd\u003eAlt\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003e/\u003c/kbd\u003e a `รท` is inserted (because that is how the keyboard layout is defined) but many other programs detects it properly.\n\nAre there plans to fix issues like these in AeroSpace or are they effectively closed as \"wont fix\"?\n\nI'll try to see if I can combine it with skhd but it would be great if it worked out of the box.","files":null}]}
