No crash logs because Aerospace never crashes.\n\nOS: Version 15.0 (24A335)\nXcode: Version 16.0 (16A242d)\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
