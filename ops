(i.e Open new Project -\u003e Attach Window) They appear as tabs above your editor tabs, which is a very nice feature.  \n\nAerospace interprets these as individual windows and attempts to tile them, which results in large blank spaces where these windows would normally be.  (they remain attached to a single window, but Aerospace will display a blank tile for each additional window) \n\nA great way of handling this is to always join new jetbrains windows, and then put them in an accordion. It's really slick if you set the accordion gap to 0, and you essentially get to ALT-J/K through your open projects.  \n\nThe only hassle is that you have to micro-manage it. It would be great if we could automatically join up all jetbrains windows and set them to a vertical accordion layout.","files":null}]}
