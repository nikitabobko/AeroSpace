I myself struggle a lot remembering shortcuts so I went ahead and created a small raycast application and menubar extension to help myself to search for things easily until it becomes muscle memory.\n\nI don't know whether you'd like to mention in anywhere in the docs or so that I can contribute it the docs myself.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.raycast.com/limonkufu/aerospace\n\nLet me know what you think and again thanks for the awesome app.","files":null}]}
