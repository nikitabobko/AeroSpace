Previously I use AltTab to see which window in which workspace with vanilla macOS space, but that does not apply to Aerospace.\n\nPotential workarounds that do not work: Use CLI command to extract information. However, because of the overhead of CLI, this solution is imperfect now. In specific, one CLI call costs 60ms on my machine (where Swift runtime initialization could costs 10ms, tested by `aerospace list-windows` returning help message), and 400ms for querying all my 10 workspaces, which is an unacceptable lag (related to #104). Another approach is to query many workspaces in one call. However, current response does not separate windows in different workspaces, therefore cannot be used for this purpose.\n\nPotential Solution:\n1. In the toolbar dropdown, add the count of windows in workspace to each workspace.\n2. Add more information when querying multiple workspaces, e.g. adding workspace names to the window information.\n3. Optimize CLI call performance.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1726596571,"nonce":"rnj3e+OA2J7CtEIxNl7JCEBnXg4=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6MdrQs","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/174#issuecomment-2356589612"},"message":"This issue is mostly resolved with the new introduced \"aerospace list-windows --format\", which can get windows and their space ids in one 60ms command.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1726596571,"nonce":"bVj4KeBXZAcSL2MGRXFlrF8/pQ4=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6BBL_WzwAAAANUEOxo"},"status":2}]}
