This can be solved like that:\n```toml\nalt-tab = 'exec-and-forget aerospace list-workspaces --all | aerospace workspace --wrap-around next'\nalt-shift-tab = 'exec-and-forget aerospace list-workspaces --all | aerospace workspace --wrap-around prev'\n```\n\nHowever, this adds significant delay: ~30-50ms for listing workspaces, and 50+ ms for spawning bash and piping/calling `aerospace workspace`.\n\nHaving static list of workspaces, `aerospace list-workspaces --all` can be replaced with `seq 1 9` or even static `echo $'1\\n2\\n...'`, however this does not eliminate overhead of spawning subprocesses and calling `aerospace` CLI, which becomes noticeable, because I navigate workspaces in that way quite a lot.\n\n### Proposal\n\nArgument `--all`  could be added to `workspace (next|prev)` syntax to implement this kind of behaviour (similar to `list-(windows|workspaces)`)\n\nI'd be happy to submit a PR if you're okay with such feature.","files":null}]}
