I can't see setting it aside from the general attribute, but it would be nice. Reason being Zed editor opens several windows but has its own project switching. So I put them all on the same workspace, but don't need the accordion padding.\n\nI didn't want to open another issue as this doesn't really seem like a bug and is closely related to this question.\n\n_Originally posted by @theherk in https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/374#issuecomment-2391266194_","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1727996255,"nonce":"ZfWftZqOHHLr2/iV7Bahp5VmbGg=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6Omk-I","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/558#issuecomment-2392477576"},"message":"@theherk no, it's not possible, and I think it's conceptually wrong to render containers differently based on a workspace.\n\nFrankly speaking, I don't understand why would someone want to set paddings to zero, since it makes it hard to understand that there are more than 1 window in the container, and it makes it hard to know the orientation of the accordion.\n\nThat being said, you can easily patch AeroSpace to achieve what you need:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/Sources/AppBundle/layout/layoutRecursive.swift b/Sources/AppBundle/layout/layoutRecursive.swift\nindex d1d00287..a9513c6f 100644\n--- a/Sources/AppBundle/layout/layoutRecursive.swift\n+++ b/Sources/AppBundle/layout/layoutRecursive.swift\n@@ -123,7 +123,7 @@ private extension TilingContainer {\n     func layoutAccordion(_ point: CGPoint, width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat, virtual: Rect, _ context: LayoutContext) {\n         guard let mruIndex: Int = mostRecentChild?.ownIndexOrNil else { return }\n         for (index, child) in children.enumerated() {\n-            let padding = CGFloat(config.accordionPadding)\n+            let padding = CGFloat(context.workspace.name == \"zed-workspace\" ? 0 : config.accordionPadding)\n             let (lPadding, rPadding): (CGFloat, CGFloat) = switch index {\n                 case 0 where children.count == 1: (0, 0)\n                 case 0:                           (0, padding)\n```\n\nIn future, it will be easier to install AeroSpace directly from sources #530","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1727996255,"nonce":"mJQQFD5cRo5OTvst6mQZzwA37rE=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6Y5LaAzwAAAANg7p-4"},"status":2},{"type":2,"timestamp":1727996282,"nonce":"vheWAYZZjPX2iS6hqViao4Lhbac=","metadata":{"github-id":"RTE_lADOJl1IZM6Y5LaAzwAAAANg7qrz"},"title":"accordion-padding per workspace","was":"accordion-padding per workspace"},{"type":5,"timestamp":1727996440,"nonce":"NiFF17R2DOCmC7F+VxuR90bdfeE=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6Y5LaAzwAAAANg7uq-"},"added":["question/discussion"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"timestamp":1727997088,"nonce":"nvBDLf0OYllE0W7eTPfYqimk+3A=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6OmoNS","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/558#issuecomment-2392490834"},"message":"\u003e Frankly speaking, I don't understand why would someone want to set paddings to zero\n\nConceptually, it maybe should be a separate \"fullscreen-like\" layout (NB: don't confuse it with the `fullscreen` command), but a more concrete proposal should be made.
