Since my `alt-comma` and `alt-slash` were not working anymore, I decided to add them to the `service` mode. So I did this:\n\n```\nctrl-alt-esc = 'mode service'\n\n[mode.service.binding]\nslash = ['layout tiles horizontal vertical', 'mode main']\ncomma = ['layout accordion horizontal vertical', 'mode main']\n```\n\nBut it did not work! I just got stuck in service mode because there was no reaction to `,` or `/` keys while in the mode. \n\nI changed the setup to this and now it's all good:\n\n```\nctrl-alt-esc = 'mode service'\n\n[mode.service.binding]\nctrl-alt-slash = ['layout tiles horizontal vertical', 'mode main']\nctrl-alt-comma = ['layout accordion horizontal vertical', 'mode main']\n```\n\nTechnically I can't swear that this issue with bindings in modes is the same as the one that prevents alt combos from working -- but both these problems certainly kicked in for me at exactly the same time.","files":null}]}
