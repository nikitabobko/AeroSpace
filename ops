The [default bindings](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/config-examples.html#default-config) bind `alt-[a-z]` and I'd like those to become unbound so that they're passed through to the actual software I'm using.\n\nSo, I created an .aerospace.toml file that redefines all of `[mode.main.binding]` without these bindings.  I reloaded the config, and this resulted in the A-Z workspaces disappearing from the dropdown list, but hitting e.g. `alt-b` in fact still switched to workspace B, which then appeared in the list.  Switching to workspace 0 made it disappear from the list.\n\nRestarting aerospace entirely got the desired effect, where aerospace is not intercepting `alt-[a-z]`.","files":null}]}
