It's helpful to add some human-readable metadata to the workspace numbers describing the focus of the workspace. In i3, commands like `workspace number 1` will continue to work if a workspace is renamed with a `:...` suffix like `1:firefox`, so the names can be changed on the fly without changing the config. It's also helpful to be able to reorganize the ordering of your workspaces. Another important use-case this enables is temporarily moving workspaces out of the top 10 (or however many you have with active bindings) when you know that you won't need them for a while. I'll often push inactive workspaces out into the 11-20 range and then swap them back in when I need them again days or weeks later.\n\nHere's an example of how I configured this in i3 to allow for easily moving and renaming workspaces:\n\n```\nbindsym Mod4+Shift+i exec i3-input\nbindsym Mod4+i exec i3-input -F 'rename workspace to \"%s'$(i3-msg -t get_workspaces | jq '.[] | select(.focused==true).name' | sed 's/[0-9]\\+\\(.*\\)/\\1/g' | sed 's/\"//g')'\"' -P 'Renumber workspace to: '\n```","files":null}]}
