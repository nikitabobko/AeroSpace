It's a lot of effort to put so many details in the report\n\n\u003e aerospace debug-windows didn't give me any output relevant to these windows (presumably because they close instantly; too fast for the watcher to pick up).\n\n`debug-windows` didn't give any output because AeroSpace doesn't even treat those IntelliJ popups as windows. I agree that `debug-windows` should be changed to include non-windows in the output\n\n\u003e my problem happens with 'Search Everywhere' and any code completion/intellisense popups.\nAs soon as I open them, it feels like AeroSpace attempts to 'take control' of the windows, effectively closing them before I can do anything.\n\nTaking into account everything you've described, I have no idea what might be causing this behavior. I happily use IntelliJ IDEA daily and don't have these problems. So it's something with your setup. \n\nI suggest you start from the beginning: comment everything out in your `aerospace.toml` config, disable hammerspoon/skhd integrations, and see if the problem is still there. Then enable integrations and features one by one to see when the problem manifests itself","files":null}]}
