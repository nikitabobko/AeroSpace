Sequoia has implemented several changes to this API, which has caused problems for window managers like [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/issues/1662). Unfortunately, I am not familiar enough with this API to identify the exact issue. It might be possible to reproduce the problem using a demo app in Xcode by comparing the list of windows reported by the accessibility API before and after closing a window. This could then be reported to the developers of the affected apps. The Contexts app hasn't been updated for several years, so I have now switched to an alternative.\n\nHey @FelixLisczyk , I also use currently use Contexts app for MacOS, but it's buggy with AeroSpace. What alternative have you switched to?","files":null}]}
