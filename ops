My foal is to make the Bob applicaion window float whenecer it appears,instead of having it open in a new workspace.\n\nHere is the current configuarion i am useing :\n``` toml\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.hezongyidev.Bob'\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nrun = 'layout floating'\n\n```\n### Problem:\nDespite this configuration, Bob’s window still opens in a new workspace rather than floating. I’ve confirmed the app ID is correct using the following command:\n\n```shell\n\nmdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -r /Applications/bob.app\n```\nThis returns: com.hezongyidev.Bob\n\n### Hypothesis:\nI suspect the issue may be related to how Bob operates. The application primarily uses floating windows to display information, and it’s possible that these floating windows are invoked through a system-level API that doesn’t directly associate them with Bob’s main application process. This might explain why Aerospace isn’t handling them as expected. If the floating window is technically not part of the bob application (from the perspective of the window manager), it might not be applying the expected layout.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1630\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e8cd57-bf2e-4880-bda8-544f666dabe9\"\u003e","files":null}]}
