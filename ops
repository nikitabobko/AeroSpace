But I still don't understand if it's possible to do what I want, which is \"when I press alt-ø\" on my norwegian keyboard, I'd like to execute the command 'fullscreen'.\n\nFrom your reply, I tested setting:\n\n```toml\n[key-mapping.key-notation-to-key-code]\n'ø' = 'f'\n```\n\nand this works. However, I cannot do:\n\n```toml\n[mode.main.binding]\nalt-ø = ['fullscreen']\n```\n\nThen I get this:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"421\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1578f4e-34f4-48c0-aae9-71866cff0ea5\"\u003e\n\nAnd if I leave it as\n```toml\n[mode.main.binding]\nalt-f = ['fullscreen']\n```\n\nThen neither `alt-f` nor `alt-ø` runs the 'fullscreen' cmd.","files":null}]}
