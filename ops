Otherwise, move the window to the monitor in the left (wrapping around)\n\nSo I thought that the following simple zsh script would do it for me:\n\n```zsh\naerospace move left || aerospace move-node-to-monitor --wrap-around left\n```\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn't work, since `aerospace move left` does not fail when it can't move. \n\n# Feature request\nI think it would be nice for aerospace commands to return something to indicate if they \"failed\" to do what they were supposed to do. It would be enough to solve my problem.\n\n# Alternative\nAnother way to solve it would be to make `move` to work similarly to the [focus command](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#focus) (with boundaries and boundaries actions).","files":null}]}
