This generally happens after switching to a workspace, lets\nsay that I was in workspace 3 and then jumped to first workspace via\nkeybinding. Then after a second or so Aerospace jumps back to another\nworkspace. I was not able to observe a pattern that causes this.\n\nI experienced with single monitor, with embedded display and with more\nthan 1 external monitors. Happens quite randomly. Maybe somewhat related\nto #289.\n\nI know the bug description is very vague but how can I debug this? Is\nthere a way to log *what* triggered a workspace switch? Or anything\nelse I can do to debug this further? I can make changes and build a\ncustom version if you point me to right direction. Awesome project,\nonly this thing annoys me throughout the day.","files":null}]}
