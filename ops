The problem is that the order of initialization of those monitors is not the same every time I plug the hub and sometimes my _main_ gets initialized after secondary which messes up with the ordering of workspace: sometimes the workspace X appears on the monitor 1 and sometimes on the monitor 2. \n\nHopefully, being able to assign the workspace to a monitor will mitigate it.","files":null}]}
