I can purely replicate it via just running aerospace. Steps:\n\n1. Run `sleep 5 \u0026\u0026 aerospace list-windows --all`\n2. During this 5 second period open a popup inside the IDE i.e. tapping double shift\n3. See the popup disappear when the list of windows will be printed\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
