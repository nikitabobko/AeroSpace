This is convenient when using one monitor, but not with multiple.\n\nI think that `move-workspace-to-monitor` doesn't work for this case as it only allows moving a workspace already with focus to a an adjecent monitor.\n\nI'd imagine this would require a new command like `move-workspace-to-focused-monitor \u003cworkspace-name\u003e`, but please let me know if this can be achieved with the current set of commands.","files":null}]}
