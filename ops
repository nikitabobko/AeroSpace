Individual bugs must be reported as separate issues\n\nThe bug that some closed windows still take space is somehow related to using other apps like contexts app. I don't use contexts app, and I don't know what is the cause, other apps may also affect this (most probably they use accessibility api). But I think the fix suggested in this issue #445 will fix the bug.\n\n\u003e This is interesting: https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/issues/872\nIt seems that Apple is kinda restricting global shortcuts with only option as a modifier in Sequoia.\nAnd by \"interesting\" I mean \"wtf?\".\n\nIn macOS 15, Apple doesn't allow to capture hotkeys with `opt` and `opt+shift` modifier but it only affects sandboxed apps. AeroSpace is not a sandboxed, that's why it's not affected. AeroSpace needs to access accessibility API anyway, which is not available in sandbox. \n\nBut it is sad to see Apple going in this directioon https://developer.apple.com/forums//thread/763878?src=push\u0026answerId=804374022#804374022","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1726920938,"nonce":"c+rWGxIZ8YW6o7Kl3MlVcgSya8g=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6WvmvczwAAAANXR57o"},"status":2}]}
