From the docs (see the NOTE):\n\n\u003e For better or worse, macOS doesnâ€™t allow to place windows outside the visible area entirely. You will still be able to see a few pixels of \"hidden\" windows in the bottom right corner of your screen. That means, that if AeroSpace crashes badly you will still be able to manually \"unhide\" the windows by dragging these few pixels to the center of the screen.\n\nhttps://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide.html#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces","files":null}]}
