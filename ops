I don't dock much, but my physical laptop display is to the right which is why the layout was like that. I'd also be open to contribute on this if there's a potential solution you may have in mind. I know Swift pretty well.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1707198531,"nonce":"JonHEIgWY30TzyVPQfS/1fmXDNU=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5y95Yf","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/149#issuecomment-1928828447"},"message":"Is there any way to resize it bigger than that display actually? So for example, if we know ahead of time it's going to the 1920x1080p monitor, make it sized for that?","files":null}]}
