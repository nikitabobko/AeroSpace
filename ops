Please share your config\n\n\u003e can it be considered a feature? I found it super useful!\n\nIf you want to replicate this layout you can use the combination of [join-with](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands.html#join-with) and [layout](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands.html#layout) commands\n\nOr you can use the combination of [move](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands.html#move-through) (you need to \"move window out\" to create an implicit container) and [layout](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands.html#layout) commands","files":null}]}
