I'm really enjoying it. \n\nMy setup has 3 monitor (the MacBook's built-in and two external Dell ones). When AeroSpace is enabled and I try to start a recording on a specific screen with Screen Studio, the overlays that Screen Studio should be showing individually on each screen become all cluttered in a single one which makes it impossible to start the recording. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-24 at 19 52 47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ba99e4-0697-4811-8848-225ac91b4a26)\n\nDisabling AeroSpace solves the issue but it is not ideal since I want to record the screen with it on.\n\nAdditionally, I've tried the following on my config but it doesn't work. \n\n```toml\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.timpler.screenstudio'\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nrun = 'layout floating'\n```\n\nBased on that, I believe this could be related to (1) How AeroSpace manages screens and workspaces or (2) Aerospace interfering in the way the overlays are being rendered.\n\n**AeroSpace version**\n\n```\n‚ùØ aerospace --version\naerospace CLI client version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\n```\n\nLet me know if I van provide any additional information.\n\n**Edit 1:**   \n\nFurther investigating it, it looks like what is happening is that AeroSpace is moving all the overlays to the focused screen which is making them cover each other.","files":null}]}
