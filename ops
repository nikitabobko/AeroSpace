I haven't found a way to account for the clearance needed for the menubar in a way that works for both machines. \n\nI'm wondering if there's a mechanism I've missed that could make a shared configuration work for both hardware types; if not, this is probs a duplicate of #115.\n\n## Detail\n\nThe issue seems to be that the origin AeroSpace uses for window management differs on notched vs un-notched hardware; I vaguely understand this corresponds to how things work in the macOS APIs.\n\n- on the M1, point 0,0 seems to be the corner of the display\n    - the menubar is rendered at 0,0\n    - therefore top padding needs to be applied for AeroSpace to tile windows clear of the menu bar\n   \n- on the M3, point 0,0 seems level with the bottom of the notch\n    - the menubar is rendered _above_ the origin\n    - therefore no top padding should be applied to clear the menu bar.\n\nI don't see a solution that allows one configuration to handle both cases out-of-the box. \n1. `aerospace list-monitors` reports `Built-in Retina Display` on both machines, meaning per-machine configuration doesn't apply\n2. I don't see a documented command that can set padding settings dynamically.\n\nCan you think of a way to configure this via the existing configuration mechanism?\n\nThe workaround I'm contemplating is templating the TOML configuration file; my nix-darwin config knows which machines have notches, so I can apply different padding values for different systems that way. But it's obviously not the nicest way to accomplish this. :)\n\nThanks so much for implementing and maintaining this project. ðŸ’œ \n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
