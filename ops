I understand the argument against configuration bloat; I'm all there with you for the most part - big fan of opinionated tools. However, in this specific case, the blessed behaviour actually _entirely prevents_ a class of users from accessing the tool, which is exactly where an option is the correct choice. (=","files":null}]}
