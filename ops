For example, if `a` is behind `b`, and you focus `c` then `a` will currently stay in-front of `b` even though `b` is a sibling to the currently focused window `c`. Changing this such that `a` appears behind `b` even though `c` was the focused window will help as a visual cue to orientation when navigating nodes in the tree.","files":null}]}
