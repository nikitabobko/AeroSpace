Is this something you can solely configure in aerospace config, or something on the OS level?\n\nThe only part I did outside aerospace was mapping caps-lock to `ctrl-alt-cmd` using karabiner-elements, and I have that because it easier using caps lock instead of `ctrl-alt-cmd`. Also using shift-caps-lock is much more convenient for me compared to `ctrl-alt-cmd-shift`.","files":null}]}
