I would love to use it to set certain apps that are in floating to a certain size on my screen. \nA simple option to center elements would also be great. I'm using Hammerspoon right now to re-center all the floating windows at the moment, but it would be much easier if you could add a **'center-window'** option, furthermore than the **resize** option. \nThanks a lot, keep up the great work!","files":null}]}
