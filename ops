First of all, I'm very impressed by this tool! When I moved to MacOs I lost hope to find anything similar to i3. I installed it yesterday and I already feel home :)\n\nI also agree that issue is more a nuisance than an actual problem (actually there is only **one** application that is giving me a small issue, that is Photoshop, it flickers on the bottom right corner, I'm wondering if I can disable Photoshop to manage its own window).\n\nMacOs has a native \"hide\" function (I guess we all know `âŒ˜+H`), would this work? Or using an extra desktop as a \"closet\" where to move unused windows?","files":null}]}
