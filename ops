I meant `System Settings -\u003e Desktop \u0026 Dock -\u003e Displays have separate Spaces`. `Group windows by application` is irrelevant\n\nI had everything disabled under `System Settings -\u003e Desktop \u0026 Dock`, so my problem is not related to `Displays have separate Spaces` (except `When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application` which I disabled after to see if it makes a difference and seemingly it did not change anything either).\n\n\u003e \u003e Also: have you disabled window decorations for some of the apps? I think it might be related as well\n\u003e\n\u003e Yes, I have an Emacs instance running without window decorations. I'll try to use with decorations on report if there is an improvement.\n\nI tried out turning window decorations back and this seems to fix the issue. Emacs creates some _child frames_ time to time, which I guess are windows without decorations and they seem to cause the problem again. I went ahead and tried turning them off as much as I can and for a day or two I haven't had the problem I mentioned. So I can confirm this indeed is caused by apps without window decorations.","files":null}]}
