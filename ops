It seems to happen more frequently when if you drag the window to another monitor quickly. This happens frequently on my machine.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Open a window (Firefox for example)\n2. Set the window to floating\n3. Drag the window to the other monitor. \n4. Repeat (3) a few times if the window doesn't jump back. Quickly drag the window back and forth to improve chances that this occurs.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1726238006,"nonce":"ENQ3Uk6m1MkaFgxk1PVNCte2qVQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6MBIgO","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/347#issuecomment-2349107214"},"message":"Anecdotally, this seems to happen more frequently when 'Displays have separate spaces' is disabled.","files":null}]}
