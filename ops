After sometime of using it, Aerospace stops working newly opened windows and does not recognize them, but it continues to work for already opened windows. Running `aerospace list-windows --all` does not list the new windows. It used to work flawlessly before this. \n\nI'm using AeroSpace-v0.13.4-Beta and macOS Sonoma Version 14.5. \n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
