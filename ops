My current main mode only has one binding to enter an alt mode with all my single key bindings to navigate windows etc. The space bar is the exit binding from this alt mode. Being able to setup mouse events to also exit this alt mode would be very handy and useful to not accidentally forget that I'm in the alt mode.","files":null}]}
