The main use cases is that I primarily use aerospace on a laptop and on a very large external display (but in a single display mode). When switching between the 2 i generally prefer to remove the padding on the laptop but keep it on the large display as well as other various minor tweaks. The current workaround is to have 2 separate cfg files with a script to switch between them and reload the config and that works fine, but it would be great if there's a way to do that explicitly in configuration.","files":null}]}
