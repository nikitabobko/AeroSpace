For example, take 4 windows in a vertical accordion and merge the middle 2 into a horizontal tile layout. You end up with a layout that looks like this:\n\n```\nwindow 1\n\nwindow 2 | window 3\n\nwindow 4\n```\n\nIf you navigate up and down the accordion you'll see that only one of windows 2 or 3 becomes visible, but never both. Navigating to window 1 will make window 1-3 visible, then navigating to window 2 will make windows 1, 2 and 4 visible. I'm not sure how you would easily be able to figure out which of the windows is not currently visible in a mixed accordion/tile layout like that, especially if they could be arbitrarily nested and positioned within the accordion. \n\nUnless this is not the intended behavior, and both windows 2 and 3 are meant to become visible when you navigate down the stack - in which case `--visible` would also be pretty straight forward to implement.","files":null}]}
