When I open the notification the workspace doesn't switch but when I close that window then it seems to switch. \n\nDifferent topic, and I can open a separate issue if you're interested in it, but for floating windows I think it might be interesting if you use the `move` command, or a new command, to \"nudge\" the window in a direction so even for floating windows you wouldn't need to reach for a mouse. So for example you could use `alt-shift-h` to slide a window to the left.","files":null}]}
