I think the issue might involve an app that never actually gets focus, but still sits there waiting for a password input. Generally speaking, on macOS, if password input is focused, global shortcuts don't work, this is a known behavior.\n\u003e \n\u003e How to reproduce:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Log out, then log back in with Bitwarden set to run at login and waiting for a password.\n\u003e 2. Lock the session.\n\u003e 3. Unlock the session.\n\u003e 4. Shortcuts are now broken.\n\u003e \n\u003e It seems like at step 4, there’s some hidden password input that “has focus,” causing the OS to disable shortcuts. If you ever bring that app to the foreground, click on somewhere else to defocus password input or kill it, shortcuts start working again, even after another lock/unlock cycle. Removing Bitwarden from the login items also fixes this.\n\u003e \n\u003e I’m guessing this isn’t limited to Bitwarden. Any app that starts up focused on a password input could cause the same kind of shortcut lockout.\n\nI experienced this a ton back when I used Yabai/skhd. (Some?) password input fields enable \"secure input\" mode - basically, macOS's way of preventing keystroke logging. My Yabai/skhd keyboard shortcuts never worked when e.g. I had Chrome open in the background, with the cursor sitting in the password field waiting to login to my Proxmox server. The interesting thing is, I don't run into that situation using Aerospace, despite the same circumstances coming up all the time.\n\nMaybe Apple updated the APIs for dealing with this but some apps (e.g. BitWarden) are still using an old method? Shot in the dark. It's interesting nonetheless.","files":null}]}
