Then it should be possible to create keymaps and callbacks in a much more flexible manner, as well as organize the config into multiple parts.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis thought came out of the frustration of trying to configure some specific tasks, and then having to resort to other tools to pull it off.\n\nA few examples of things I tried to do that were limit by the current configs:\n\n- Have different rules apply to my work and personal computers configs while maintaining the same code base (unsolved)\n- Auto close / minimize the \"Zoom\" login window it appears (solved with BetterTouchTool)\n- Move Chrome's floating window on workplace changes (solved by external script)\n\n# Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/weyhan/lua4swift\nhttps://github.com/SwiftyLua/SwiftyLua?tab=readme-ov-file","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1735324258,"nonce":"7rMymRi3c6hVMuym3Eb1Dj2y8js=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6klBINzwAAAAOsOP_3"},"added":["feature-proposal"],"removed":[]}]}
