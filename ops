I have a laptop monitor (A) together with an extrawide external monitor (B).\n\nOn A, I want the two accordions in a horizontal accordion because it is not wide enough to have the windows side by side. On B I want them tiled because it has enough room. \n\nNow when I move a workspace from one monitor to the other, I also want to switch the layout of the root node.\nI haven't figured out a way to do this so I'm forced to reset the layout and set it up again which is quite a hassle.\n\nThe ability to toggle the layout of the root node would solve this for me.\nSomething like this would do the trick: `aerospace layout --root tiles accordion`\n\nAlternatively aerospace could automatically collapse tiles to accordions when becoming too narrow. Optionally, of course.\u003c/div\u003e","files":null}]}
