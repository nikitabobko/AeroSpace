At least for me, it disturbed my workflow, as I have an ultra-wide monitor with multiple browser instances in a horizontal accordion container and keep my IDE next to it on the same workspace, and switching back and forth between native fullscreen in a e.g. Youtube video completely destroys my layout.\n\n\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT 0589ac7d3071042e0c17e80dd517a0bcdbf798e9\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT 0589ac7d3071042e0c17e80dd517a0bcdbf798e9\n```","files":null}]}
