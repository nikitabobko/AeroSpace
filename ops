That dialog won't always show up as a window itself, for example in accordion mode where it will be minimized. Clicking \"confirm\" i.e. answering a call will mess up the layout, as will clicking \"Join meeting\" when someone else has started a meeting.\n\nI'll work in the new Teams version and see if I can still reproduce the issue. If not, this problem may solve itself as I'm sure Teams is not going to support their classic version forever. :)","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1700479865,"nonce":"rOlmrOF0fZxnARzd3tE9Mb3Gadw=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5sadp2","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/13#issuecomment-1818876534"},"message":"Happy to report that this bug can no longer be reproduced once you move to the new Teams application.","files":null}]}
