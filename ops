(in macOS, the menu is not within window borders) Once the mouse is moved out of the window border, the focus changes\n\nThis happens to me in yabai; I usually just cmd+tab back to the window that previously had focus once I reach the menubar. Not ideal, but it's an acceptable tradeoff. Probably worth noting that I personally do not use \"mouse follows focus\" as I sometimes switch to a window just to use a keyboard shortcut and don't want the mouse jumping around on me.","files":null}]}
