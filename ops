Basically I have a workspace assigned to move to a specific monitor, with workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment and what happens is that, whenever I disconnect my monitor and I connect it again with the workspace I have assigned to force move, it will not move and will stay on the main monitor, even though I have it forced moved. If I have any other workspace focus on the moment I will connect the monitor again, then it works perfectly fine.\n\nAm I missing some configuration or something?\n\nthanks in advance…\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
