It seems to happen more frequently when if you drag the window to another monitor quickly. This happens frequently on my machine.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Open a window (Firefox for example)\n2. Set the window to floating\n3. Drag the window to the other monitor. \n4. Repeat (3) a few times if it the window doesn't jump back. Quickly drag the window back and forth to improve chances that this occurs.","files":null}]}
