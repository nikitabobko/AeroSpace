Sometime I want to be fullscreen all the time. That means, when I switch windows in same workspace, I need to do alt-h + alt-f, then alt-l + alt-f, etc., which is extra keystrokes\n- accordion is indeed close to what I want, but it waistes a bit of space on the screen (especially when you are on laptop). Usually I know what other windows I have, I don't need to see them all the time.","files":null}]}
