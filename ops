Showing my config (float everything)\n![aerospace-demo-enabled-1](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/c0bcecf0-cb86-4ebd-8240-a676f6cb8ad0)\n\n2. Showing the instant disappearing windows\n![aerospace-demo-enabled-2](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/06c4c96f-0b94-4c27-9048-0deb24d9fc88)\n\n3. Showing the expected behaviour that is restored when Aerospace is disabled again:\n![aerospace-demo-disabled](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/edfcc6c2-d4e9-4bf2-b1f6-314a54194a47)\n\n## Accessibility app screenshots\nI did take some screenshots with the accessibility app once Aerospace was disabled and the windows stayed open long enough. `aerospace debug-windows` didn't give me any output relevant to these windows (presumably because they close instantly; too fast for the watcher to pick up).\n\nSearch dialogs:\n![2024-02-20_22-48](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/ecdbc3cf-7cda-41e7-9a5b-ae866bb7b017)\n\n![2024-02-20_22-47](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/b4e04fcd-e9b8-41b5-9d6a-491f4e21895b)\n\n\nCode completion:\n\n![2024-02-20_22-49](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/12594234/1e06ac83-c718-4f61-ba13-e78b55b6afb1)\n\n## Other info\n- AeroSpace version: v0.8.5-Beta d41205f\n- macOS version: macos Ventura 13.6.4\n- Your keyboard layouts (in case of global hotkeys handling problem): Use of hammerspoon/skhd for keybindings to focus windows directly to workaround `aerospace focus` not allowing us to focus specific windows yet.. but otherwise nothing fancy. Can provide configs if you think they'd be relevant.\n\n## What have I tried?\n\n* Set everything to floating\n* window callback using app regex and set to floating\n\n## Question\n\n1. Am I the only one experience this/something similar and are there any known window callback rules or workarounds that would help?\n2. Failing that, is there any way existing or planned to allow certain windows to be completely ignored (rather than forced to floating layout?). Wondering if it would be better for windows like this to be completely left alone rather than handled by aerospace but floating.\n3. Any other ideas for addressing this? \n\nThanks in advance, really hoping some workaround exists since it seems like others here use IntelliJ IDEs! Happy provide more info if needed ðŸ¤ž \n\n(Also let me know if this is, indeed, a dupe - happy to move this to a comment somewhere if it works better)","files":null}]}
