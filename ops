When that happens and I try to navigate to it, aerospace also freezes and doesn't recover until the IDE window recovers. Sometimes it also crashes. If i don't try to navigate to it, AeroSpace is fine.\n\nI am not sure if it is because of `on-focus-changed = ['move-mouse window-lazy-center']` or something else.\n\nIdeally AeroSpace should be resilient to other applications not responding.","files":null}]}
