Number one has my terminal and Brave browser, number two has teams and Firefox. I keep both layouts in accordion mode.\n\nToday I noticed that Microsoft Teams broke layout 2 when I entered a meeting. Everything worked just fine when entering the meeting, but when I left and the window was of course removed, I had a gap between the active Teams window and the edge of my screen, which showed my desktop. \n\nI tried focusing Firefox and refocusing Teams, but the gap stayed. I also tried moving Teams to a random number like 8. This solved layout 2 in that Firefox took up the whole screen. But then if I moved back to layout 8 and tried moving it back to layout 2, the indicator at the stop still said 8. And then if I navigated to layout 2, it would still show as layout 8 and focus the Teams app.\n\nThis problem went away when I quit Teams and reopened it.","files":null}]}
