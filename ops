This happens most often on floating windows.\n\nIn this situation, I find myself disabling aerospace then ATL+TABing to the window so I can interact with it, then when I'm done with that window, I re-enable aerospace. This is a bit of a pain.\n\nIt would be great if there was a way of telling which workspace an application has a window on, like in the list of workspaces in the menu bar. In that case, I could (presumably) switch to the relevant workspace then ALT+TAB the floating window to bring it to the foreground.\n\nI can't express how much I love using Aerospace. I recommend it to anyone that I know uses macOS. Thank you so much for making and sharing it!","files":null}]}
