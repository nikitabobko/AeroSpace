It doesn't show up, the workspace is empty!\n\nWhen it does show up, when I switch to workspace #3, the windows in that workspace don't show up!\n\nIt seems Aerospace is having trouble with my basic setup. Is there a debug mode where more information is available to help figure this out?\n\nI saw this before and after upgrading to 14.2. I also tried toggling the Dock \u0026 Display settings listed in the README. I didn't notice any difference.","files":null}]}
