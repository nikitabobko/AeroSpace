Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned Hammerspoon as the issue here is somehow \"pure\" AeroSpace. I mentioned Hammerspoon only because that's what I'm using now to toggle my terminal, and I was hoping to replace it with the script you provided, but, for some reason, the window size changes when I toggle it.\n\nBUT ... as I was writing this, I gave it another try ... and:\n- Seems like the issue I'm seeing is actually _because_ I've adjusted the window size using Hammerspoon.\n- When I toggle (show) the terminal using the script, adjust the size manually, and use the script again to hide/show, the window appears properly.\n\nI really wish AeroSpace allowed resizing floating windows üôÅ","files":null}]}
