It's known problem and I can reproduce it. There are several directions to investigate\n\n1. Make use of `AXUIElementSetMessagingTimeout`, and implement some kind of backoff strategy for applications that hang\n2. Dedicate a thread for each application and issue AX requests from them (IDK if it's a thread-safe)\n\nRelated yabai discussions: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/2377 https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/599 https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/600\n\nUntil I have time to dig into this problem, everyone else is welcome to do so","files":null}]}
