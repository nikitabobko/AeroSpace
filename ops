I just bought a Macbook and my former PC was a Linux machine (in which I ran i3wm). In i3 I had the following bind:\n\"bindsym $mod+Ctrl+Shift+q exec kitty -e --hold python ~/RandomISS.py\"\nI decided to try and run it in my mac through AeroSpace, but I can't seem to find a way to run a program and inject a script into it just like I did in i3. Is there a way to do this in AeroSpace?\n\nI tried 'alt-shift-z = 'exec-and-forget open -n /Applications/iTerm.app python ~/RandomISS.py'', as well as 'exec-and-forget open -n /Applications/kitty.app -e python ~/RandomISS.py' (and many other variations, to no avail.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
