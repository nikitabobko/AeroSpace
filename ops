I can't see setting it aside from the general attribute, but it would be nice. Reason being Zed editor opens several windows but has its own project switching. So I put them all on the same workspace, but don't need the accordion padding.\n\nI didn't want to open another issue as this doesn't really seem like a bug and is closely related to this question.\n\n_Originally posted by @theherk in https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/374#issuecomment-2391266194_","files":null}]}
