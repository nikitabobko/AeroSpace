In that case, I would, of course, defer to your vision of what aerospace would be. \n\nHandling scripting outside of the configuration would be a neat approach and honestly, the improvements discussed about reducing the latency would be sufficient for this. \n\nRight now, to properly handle visible workspaces being highlighted in sketchybar for example, I need to call an `aerospace list-workspaces` command on the workspace change callback. This noticeably introduces latency in the sketchybar focus icon switching (all else being equal, it's not exactly instant even without this call). If this didn't have substantial latency, this would be no issue at all!","files":null}]}
