Being focused on the left node, I need to switch focus to the accordion layout on the right side, switch focus on the accordion layout, and return to the node on the left side of the screen. \n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
