There is no current capability for intermediate zoom states beyond the full-screen or multiple visible windows without any priority.\n\n### Current Behavior\nCurrently, the options allow either a single application to occupy the full screen or multiple applications to share the screen without any prioritization. This binary choice does not support scenarios where visibility of more than one but not all windows is desirable.\n\n### Proposed Feature\nIntroduce a new zoom feature that allows one of the windows in a multi-window container to be temporarily expanded to fill its parent container, making it the focal point while still keeping at least one other window visible. \nThis feature would be similar to zoom-parent in `Yabai`, allowing for dynamic resizing of windows within their current containers to better manage screen real estate, especially in complex multi-window setups.\n\n### Example Configuration\nAn example of how windows are currently organized:\n```\nh_tiles\n├── window 1\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2\n    └── window 3\n```\n    \nDesired behaviour after implementing the feature:\n```\nh_tiles\n├── window 1 (visible)\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2 (not visible - behind window 3)\n    └── window 3 (visible - zoomed)\n```\n    \nIn this configuration, while window 3 is in focus, it can be toggled to 'zoom' and fill the container size, pushing window 2 into the background, similarly to how fullscreen works but within a smaller scope.\n\n### Additional Context\nThis functionality is inspired by the zoom-parent feature in Yabai, which proved extremely useful for managing multiple windows efficiently and it was actually my main zoom option since it would behave the same as the `fullscreen`when only 2 windows were being displayed.\nHere's how I had the configuration in Yabai:\n\n```\nalt - f : yabai -m window --toggle zoom-parent\nctrl + alt - f : yabai -m window --toggle zoom-fullscreen\nshift + ctrl + alt - f : yabai -m window --toggle native-fullscreen\n```\n\nThis feature would significantly enhance usability in environments with extensive multitasking demands.","files":null}]}
