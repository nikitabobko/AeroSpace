A concrete proposals on how it could work are welcome (e.g. what flags, what commands or maybe a boolean flag inside a layout need to be added). Description of more use cases are welcome too\n\nIn i3, it's done via `focus child|parent` #5 But I am not sure that I like the i3 approach because users always need to firstly run `focus parent` before moving a stack of windows around.","files":null}]}
