I found that in  server.swift the .sock file is being created, right? Would changing the .sock file created there to say something like `/tmp/\\(Bundle.appId).\\(NSUserName()).sock` do the trick?\n\nIn my non-existent knowledge of how the .sock file is being created it seems like it's a permissions error, instead of dealing with file permissions, can this be changed easily to a more unique identifier to allow multiple users? Of course, I'm not sure if this will be a simple fix\n\nI'm willing to test this and learn something from a new language while I'm at it.","files":null}]}
