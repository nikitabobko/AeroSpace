I open 2 windows: 1 finder, 1 iterm\n2. In iterm I type: `aerospace join-with left`\n3. the 2 windows are displayed now vertically but the screen is flickering I have to quit iterm to stop that or do `aerospace move right`\n\nAny hint on how to fix that?\n\naerospace version: \n`âžœ  ~ aerospace -v\naerospace CLI client version: 0.12.0-Beta 9cf82feb0c85bea77fedcdc6b8cdba75b5bbf1f8\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.12.0-Beta 9cf82feb0c85bea77fedcdc6b8cdba75b5bbf1f8`","files":null}]}
