You're not the first person to express a willingness to offer financial support for the project.\n\nBut money is a complicated matter. I haven't figured out whether I want to get paid for the AeroSpace. Money means obligations (or might be considered as such by some people), and I don't want to get obligated.\n\nIf at some point I see that AeroSpace takes more time than I want to then I will consider financing.\n\nThank you","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1702944950,"nonce":"2UBEiOpH5AE2SwQIzizsfgYf6kY=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5u-k27","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/51#issuecomment-1861897659"},"message":"I'm closing this issue since it's fixed.
