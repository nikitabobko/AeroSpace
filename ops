I am trying to configure aerospace to start both sketchybar and borders with my configurations. The docs specify to do the following:\n\n```\nafter-startup-command = [\n    # JankyBorders has a built-in detection of already running process,\n    # so it won't be run twice on AeroSpace restart\n    'exec-and-forget borders active_color=0xffe1e3e4 inactive_color=0xff494d64 width=5.0'\n]\n```\n```\nafter-startup-command = ['exec-and-forget sketchybar']\n\n# Notify Sketchybar about workspace change\nexec-on-workspace-change = ['/bin/bash', '-c',\n    'sketchybar --trigger aerospace_workspace_change FOCUSED_WORKSPACE=$AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE'\n]\n```\nI have done both of the above and neither will run unless I provide the absolute path like so:\n\n```\nafter-startup-command = [\n  'exec-and-forget /usr/local/bin/sketchybar'\n  'exec-and-forget /usr/local/bin/borders'\n]\n```\n\nI have a config for each of these which should work, but it seems to lose any context of the configuration when ran. I can run these both individually as services, and they work fine. But Aerospace seems to lose that context. \n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
