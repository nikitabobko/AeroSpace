You unlock the screen and windows don't preserve their workspace assignment\n\nThanks for looking into it @nikitabobko! And for writing this savior of macos that makes it useable! :D\n \nSo I went to sleep with a release build that had those changes running. It locked the screen because I was away for a long time. There are no logs in that piece of code so I can't tell if it executed it for every window or not, but I can't see any strange behavior from the machine. All windows were on correct monitors. I can manage windows with hotkeys. I tried moving focus on one workspace, jumping to different workspace on the same monitor and to different monitor, resizing windows, moving windows. And then I tried closing a window of iTerm. And it behaved as it should, I didn't notice anything at all. Then I tried locking the screen myself, and I also didn't experience any effects at all. It works. \n\n\u003e Duplicate of https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/445\n\nIt says \n\u003e (e.g. if user quickly closes several windows in a row)\n\nFor me it's every time, very consistently. I don't have to do it quickly. And I don't have to do multiple in a row. It just never fires the kAXUIElementDestroyedNotification. And I also had a breakpoint in the callback there, it was never hit.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1730468180,"nonce":"A6+E6NyEFdGv6h1XU9WZd9LRbFQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6SJMw8","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/653#issuecomment-2451885116"},"message":"[release.tgz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17600067/release.tgz)\nthat's a release build of the tip of master branch with my changes, if anyone wants to check if that works.
