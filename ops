The only modification I made to your config before testing was the `key-mapping.preset = dvorak` on line 36 as I don't use that mapping.\n\nThis was quite an interesting experiment, as I would have bet money that using `cmd-a` to move to workspace 1 would have not worked but it works perfectly fine. I thought for sure that if an application uses `cmd-a` as a shortcut that it would override the aerospace shortcut but that's not what happened. \n\n I also tested `cmd-o` to move to workspace 2 and `cmd-u` to move to workspace 4 and those worked. It's possible that the dvorak setting could be throwing a wrench in your setup?","files":null}]}
