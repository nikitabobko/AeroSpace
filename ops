The method for assigning these indices is flexible, but one approach could be to start from the top-left corner as index 1 and proceed in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order, similar to reading a book. Implementing this feature would allow users to consistently switch to a specific window without needing to consider the current focused window's position relative to the desired window.\n\nI hope this makes sense, and thank you for the amazing work!","files":null}]}
