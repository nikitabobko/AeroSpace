I tried tons of apps, this one is the most promising, but I realized that most of the time I'm actually fighting with glitches and issues while 95% of the time I'm just using a single window without any side-by-side layouts.\n\nYou do you, but Aerospace is much more than Rectangles/Scissors. It's a full blown window manager. I love it a lot and rarely had issues and even if I had them @nikitabobko was very responsive in fixing them.","files":null}]}
