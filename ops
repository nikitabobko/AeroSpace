This mean's I prefer to have a single key-binding to change from main mode to an alt mode. In the alt mode I will have all my bindings for my commands as well as a binding to exit back to main. This minimizes chording in my keybindings.\n\nHowever, I like modal experiences where I can show a clear indicator to whether I am in a particular mode. This visual indicator aids in communicating to the user what mode is currently activated. I figured the gap config would be perfect for this: I'd have gaps set to 0 in main mode, and 10 in my alt mode.\n\nHow do I configure the toml file such that the gap is set but only for a specific mode?","files":null}]}
