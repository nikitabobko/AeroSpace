Is there a way to suppress all the window animation/movements (sort of showing the end result window at a centered position only)? Maybe this is not possible, just wondering...\n\nBy the way, I am using \"Reduce motion\" ON in my `Accessibility \u003e Display` setttings.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1722108533,"nonce":"ABBxNH9NMGLee5qPxAhNra2o1VQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6GXOMB","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/339#issuecomment-2254234369"},"message":"Related discussion: https://github.com/armindarvish/consult-omni/discussions/19#discussioncomment-10168740","files":null}]}
