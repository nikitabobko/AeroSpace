I really enjoyed the way it worked, but soon noticed that it was also hijacking the AltGr key. For Nordic keyboard layouts, the AltGr + numkeys are absolutely crucial as a developer. They enable me to write characters such as @$|[]{}\n\nAdding a binding to temporarily disable the keys, like @AmineDjeghri suggested, isn't really a viable option for day to day usage while using the computer to code. \n\nI see this has been open for quite some time now without any feedback if this is being considered, or even possible to do? @nikitabobko sorry for the direct ping, but is this on planed list of improvements? Unfortunately this completely voids aerospace for me ðŸ˜’\n\nmaybe you could support both `alt` (when you don't care which one), `lalt` and `ralt` for the bindings?\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
