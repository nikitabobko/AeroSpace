Manual installation\n2. You can host own version of homebrew installation script in your own homebrew tap\n3. Build from sources\n\nGiven alternative installation ways, I don't believe that changing the installation script will help in getting approved in your company\n\nMy opinion is that \"Apple cannot check AeroSpace for malicious software\" is a stupid \"security theater\" dialog. If users download AeroSpace, they probably want to use it, and I don't see reasons for the dialog to exist. Otherwise, just don't download the software.\n\nI understand that it's not a common practice to remove quarantine attribute in homebrew installation script, that's why there is a big notarization note in the README.","files":null}]}
