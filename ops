I guess you use `workspace (next|prev)` and you don't jump to specific workspaces by names, am I right?\n\nWould a command like `workspace --index 2` make sense in your workflow? Imagine you dropped `workspace 2` because it is no longer relevant, `workspace --index 2` would lead you to the next after the previously existed `workspace 2`","files":null}]}
