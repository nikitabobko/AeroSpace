Consider the following case:\n```\nworkspace 1 (focused)\n  h_tiles\n    window 1 (focused)\n    window 2\nworkspace 2 (\"in background\")\n  h_tiles\n    window 3\n```\n\nAnd macOS windows \"overlap stack\" (the windows on top are the most \"recent\"):\n```\nwindow 1\nwindow 3\nwindow 2\n```\n\nAeroSpace could try to \"raise\"/\"focus\" all windows of the workspace when it focuses the workspace, but in that case the focus will flicker.\n\nBesides, focusing and \"raising\" windows is probably the most invasive and the buggiest API that I had to deal with (e.g. #101).\n\nIn the initial versions of AeroSpace, I played with the exact idea you propose, and I couldn't make it work. I tried to call \"focus window\" API several times in a row for different windows (to \"raise\" windows of the workspace), and very often a wrong windows ends up being focused when you switch workspaces. Though maybe I didn't try hard enough.\n\nRelated issue: #4","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1724776987,"nonce":"H3rCHv9cmAyjzLEt+FVKkXNovzk=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6UWJx-zwAAAANEX4VS"},"status":2}]}
