If I have an accordion of tile layouts, when I move in the direction of the accordion I would expect the next tile layout would load entirely, not load a single split window and then I need to focus in the other axis to bring the rest of the tile container's windows forward. This is not a visualization improvement, it's a behavior change that matches the expectation, the expectation being you can navigate between containers and not just leaf nodes. Triggering a leaf node should bring along by default or by configuration the other leaf nodes in the closest parent container. Otherwise stacking containers on containers is not really feasible, even if the docs say you can do it.","files":null}]}
