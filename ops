I have to say, nevertheless, that the crashlog is similar to my previous one (somewhat longer, though); furthermore, the window appearing in the \"already unbound\" line is ChatGPT once again. I can attach it, but I don't know if it will add any new information (and neither the print statements; as I had been running this for a long time, I'm not sure the exact moment that the lines start referring directly to the crash).\n\nClearly, in any case, I'm not able to consistently reproduce the crash neither with lock/unlock nor with plugging/unplugging the dock. I'll go back to the production build.","files":null}]}
