When you launch AeroSpace and more than 3 windows get scheduled on the focused workspace (e.g. you can use `on-window-detected` to schedule windows on different workspaces), AeroSpace will switch the layout to accordion.\n\nIt happens only on startup to make onboarding experience better, because if there are too many windows open, `tiles` layout doesn't look that good because of min-width window restriction, and it may scare off new users.\n\nAs a workaround, you can cancel the effect of this \"smart\" behavior\n\n```toml\nafter-startup-command = ['layout tiles']\n```\n\nI agree that it's not perfect, but I don't care enough to think of a better solution.","files":null}]}
