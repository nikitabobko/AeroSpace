Therefor the user is unable to type further than just the character/s typed before.\n\n![SCR-20240108-jtem](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/24993816/939aa9e4-a0ce-4a85-a046-f465b746dd96)\n\nWithout using AeroSpace (also works with Amethyst), the user is able to keep writing until s/he manually focuses/selects the auto-complete tooltip/popup. \n\nI guess it's because of how the auto-complete is handled (probably as a new window in eclipse)... Any Idea of a possible workaround someone can think of?\n\n---\n\nTested on:\nMacOS 14.2.1\nAeroSpace 0.7.1-Beta\nDBeaver 23.3.2","files":null}]}
