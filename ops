I can't reproduce it this morning. I'm sorry. It was happening consistently last night. The only other window management app that I use is Rectangle, and it wasn't running at the time. I did just upgrade to Sonoma, but since it's working now I'm not sure what it was. You can close this, and if I run into the issue again, I can either update this ticket or create a new one (at your preference). Thanks for the quick response!","files":null}]}
