Others may, though. It would be nice if the workspaces listed in the menu bar were only the non-empty workspaces. An exception would be switching to an empty workspace to start opening some apps in. In this case, the solution could be to have the workspace shown in the label, and _possibly_ also in the list of workspaces temporarily.\n\nThe arguments I could see against this consideration are:\n- Decreased visibility of what workspaces exist to choose from.\n- Difficulty opening a new workspace via point-and-click method.","files":null}]}
