Currently when using multiple workspaces the windows that are on the same monitor but not in the active workspace are moved off to one of the bottom corners of the monitor. Currently this poses a problem for me and I can't use multiple workspaces on my main monitor because I don't have a \"good corner\".\n\nI was thinking: since the idea of a Tiling Window Manager is to maximize the space used by apps, it always covers the whole screen with windows. If you're not using gaps between windows (like I do) it kind of doesn't matter if the other windows are hidden in the corners or just left underneath the active ones â€“ they won't be visible. Would that be an option that could be easily added to Aerospace? To just leave the inactive windows on the monitor and only \"bring forward\" the ones that are in the active workspace?","files":null}]}
