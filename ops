Most of my windows are no longer being positioned correctly. \n\nLet's start with what still seems to be working. \n\n1. I can assign windows to workspaces just fine\n2. I can move to workspaces just fine\n3. It appears that apps are appropriately being auto-assigned to the right workspaces when they startup\n4. Aerospace seems to be starting up when my computer starts\n5. Any chrome window I have seems to behave perfectly\n\nBut weird things are happening within my workspaces and apps that aren't chrome. \n\nI have a workspace for my Messages and What's App client, and I can't get them to automatically tile in any way (vertically, horizontally, or with the accordion). I also can't switch between them at all. I can still move them to another screen, but besides that, it appears that they are not under the control of aerospace at all. \n\nI have a different workspace with a chrome window and an iterm2 terminal. In that workspace, I can switch between tiles appropriately, but the tiles don't align themselves as they should (they don't move at all unless I manually adjust where they sit on the screen). Not sure whether this partial working behavior is due to the fact that there is a chrome window involved or not, but it's definitely odd. \n\nI have yet another workspace where I keep my Slack app, and for whatever reason, it keeps opening only halfway vertically. I can double click the title bar to open it full screen, but that doesn't feel like it should be needed. \n\nEverything was working fine yesterday. Since yesterday, the things that I know of that are different are\n1. My computer upgraded to macOS 14.6.1\n2. I unplugged my external monitor, and then replugged it back in (the behavior above seems to be consistent whether I'm using an external monitor or just my laptop screen). \n\nI love this tool, and I'm super thankful for you working on it ðŸ™‡ \n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\nHere's my config\n\n```\n# Place a copy of this config to ~/.aerospace.toml\n# After that, you can edit ~/.aerospace.toml to your liking\n\n# It's not necessary to copy all keys to your config.\n# If the key is missing in your config, \"default-config.toml\" will serve as a fallback\n\n# You can use it to add commands that run after login to macOS user session.\n# 'start-at-login' needs to be 'true' for 'after-login-command' to work\n# Available commands: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands\nafter-login-command = []\n\n# You can use it to add commands that run after AeroSpace startup.\n# 'after-startup-command' is run after 'after-login-command'\n# Available commands : https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands\nafter-startup-command = []\n\n# Start AeroSpace at login\nstart-at-login = true \n\n# Normalizations.
