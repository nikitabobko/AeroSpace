It's something that can provide value in the meantime as in your final example (also in shell scripts) and would eventually tie in nicely with the embedded scripting language. \n\nWould you be open to a PR for this? I'd like to have a go.\n\nAs a real world use case example, it would simplify my `focus.sh` example in the original post to be:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=$1\n# just an example here. I'd have to map the direction to a key or change the script input\nKEY='somekey' \nif aerospace list-windows --focused | grep -q \"WezTerm\"; then\n aerospace trigger-binding --send-to-macos alt-$KEY\nelse\n  aerospace focus $DIR\nfi\n```","files":null}]}
