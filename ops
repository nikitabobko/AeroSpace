You seem to be on Apple silicon and I'm still on Intel, so homebrew has different install behavior. My `aerospace` lives in `/usr/local/bin`, not `/opt/homebrew/bin`.\n\nIf you're using the `start-at-login` config option in `aerospace.toml`, then AeroSpace is being started for you by `launchd`, as it is for me. It's not (unless I'm much mistaken) executing any zsh environment for either of us. Instead what's happening is AeroSpace is manually inserting the `/opt/homebrew` dir into the path as described [here](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#exec-env-vars), and probably nobody's realized that that's not good enough for Intel macs.","files":null}]}
