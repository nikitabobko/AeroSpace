Next time, please provide more details on your issues, steps to reproduce, and screenshots.\n\nFrankly speaking, I'm not sure that Alacritty is doing the right thing. They should account for the notch. Right now, the notch overlays the terminal output. I'd consider opening an issue in their tracker\n\n\u003e Ideally, if an application chooses to draw over the notch (to the top edge), it should be allow to do so.\n\nI don't think it's possible to reliably detect if the app wants to draw itself above the notch. At least I don't know how\n\nYou can write an automation (using aerospace CLI) that makes the window float, and runs the Alacritty action `ToggleSimpleFullscreen`\n\nSince I think that it can't be fixed on AeroSpace side, I am closing the issue. If somebody manages to fix it, PRs are welcome","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1704224905,"nonce":"tMCOT3nzyX3/6AYjLr/PChZ4NrM=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM561gnRzwAAAAKl5xSC"},"status":2}]}
