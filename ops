[The `Console.app` interface](https://www.uaudio.com/blog/console-getting-started/) by Universal Audio for their Apollo consoles ([download](https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/215573823-UAD-Software-Downloads)), for instance, is famously poorly-behaved, with a window that's utterly inaccessible and forces itself into strange shapes and configurations without any user-input. But others, like the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/download) gaming store, I was more surprised by.\n\nThis particular Issue is about Steam specifically; but while I'm at it - is there any known workaround for applications like this that are difficult to control? Elevating the process or anything like that?","files":null}]}
