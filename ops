I would like to ask, whether it is a bug or a feature, and if you could point me to the documentation where this behavior is described.\n\nIf it is a bug, can it be considered a feature? I found it super useful!\n\nThanks a lot for all the amazing work that is being put int AeroSpace, I really enjoy using it!","files":null}]}
