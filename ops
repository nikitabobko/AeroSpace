A command like `list-windows --dfs-order` would be ideal for this purpose. Personally, I would use this feature to integrate with SketchyBar, displaying the windows in a way that mirrors workspace organization.\n\nThe output could follow the same format as the existing `list-windows` command, but it should be ordered as if a DFS (Depth-First Search) was performed on the workspace. See the example below.\n\nh_tiles\n├── window (index: 0)\n├── v_tiles\n\u0026nbsp;|\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;├── window (index: 1)\n\u0026nbsp;|\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;└── window (index: 2)\n├── window (index: 3)\n\nI realize this is similar to the functionality proposed in https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/16, but I believe this request is still valid. It specifically focuses on the DFS ordering of windows, disregarding how they are otherwise structured within the tree.\n\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
