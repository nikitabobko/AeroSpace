Thanks for such detailed reply!\n\n\u003e As long as your provide time measurements, that prove that exec-and-forget aerospace list-workspaces --all | aerospace workspace next is noticeably slower (at least 100ms) than workspace --all next, I'm ok with such feature\n\nThanks for providing example diff! So, I tried various options (with only one monitor, but I'm pretty sure that native filtering would not add such impact):\n\n```\nalt-q = 'exec-and-forget /…/.debug/aerospace list-workspaces --all | /…/.debug/aerospace workspace --wrap-around next'\nalt-w = 'exec-and-forget seq 1 9 | /…/.debug/aerospace workspace --wrap-around next'\nalt-tab = 'workspace --wrap-around next'\n```\n\nAnd then manually checked the logs for time delta between keydown and first focused app chage event. That yielded following results on my M1 MBA:\n\n```\nalt-q 355.85, 414.78, 276.46, 361.82, 291.08, 341.92, 370.41, 332.20, 267.04\nalt-w 277.67, 238.14, 216.59, 297.80, 379.01, 424.73, 493.56, 269.42\nalt-tab 116.60, 100.33, 152.95, 170.88, 121.60, 116.59, 166.63, 95.38\n\nalt-q: mean=334.62ms stddev=45.71ms\nalt-w: mean=324.62ms stddev=91.27ms\nalt-tab: mean=130.12ms stddev=27.50ms\n```\n\nWhich is a bit weird, considering that alt-q should be a bit slower. Maybe the test was not clean enough (spaces had different number of windows), but the slow-down is substantial.\n\n\u003e Out of curiosity, why do you prefer to cycle workspace on all monitors?\n\nForce of habit, I guess. I've had an i3 setup a long time ago, with `alt-tab` for `workspace next`, not `workspace next_on_output`. Also, it's quite convenient when I have workspaces 1/2/5-9 on main display, and 3/4 on secondary. Mainly I use 1/2, but regularly switch to 3. alt-tab/alt-shift-tab is a bit quicker and requires less mental effort than alt-2/alt-3 in that case.\n\n\u003e I understand that AeroSpace could be faster https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/104, but it still makes me sad that the currently provided solution `aerospace list-workspaces --all | aerospace workspace --wrap-around next`  is slow enough for people to notice it\n\nI guess, it's not that noticeable, but I'm pretty picky :)\nOverall AeroSpace is a breath of fresh air compared to native workspace switching.\n\nI'll be happy to contribute to any performance-related improvements, do you maybe have a good first issue in mind?\n\n\u003e Copying flags from list-workspaces is an abstraction leak, and a violation of single responsibility principle.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.","files":null}]}
