This works:\n\n```\nexec-on-workspace-change = ['/bin/bash', '-c',\n  'WIN=$(aerospace list-windows --all | grep \"\u003cWindow Title\u003e\" | cut -d\" \" -f1); [ -n \"$WIN\" ] \u0026\u0026 aerospace move-node-to-workspace --window-id \"$WIN\" \"$AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE\"'\n]\n```\n\nHowever, it seemed to move the window to the focused workspace but it lost focus so it would be behind my other windows. I tried giving it focus as part of `exec-on-workspace-change` (see below), which kinda works (moves the window and gives it focus), but it's not really useable for my needs as clicking on any other window will send it to the back:\n\n```\nexec-on-workspace-change = ['/bin/bash', '-c',\n  'WIN=$(aerospace list-windows --all | grep \"\u003cWindow Title\u003e\" | cut -d\" \" -f1); [ -n \"$WIN\" ] \u0026\u0026 aerospace move-node-to-workspace --window-id \"$WIN\" \"$AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE\" \u0026\u0026 aerospace focus --window-id \"$WIN\"'\n]\n```","files":null}]}
