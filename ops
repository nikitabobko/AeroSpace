The accordion layout as a default root works as expected in other workspaces.\n\nHere are the relevant configs which can be used to reproduce:\n```\nenable-normalization-flatten-containers = false\nenable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = false\ndefault-root-container-layout = 'accordion'\ndefault-root-container-orientation = 'vertical'\n```\n\nI have tried with/without normalization as well as vertical and horizontal orientations; the issue persists.\n\nVersions:\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.16.0-Beta d172dfd8a92f2d339f3d46a12a297e43e80768ca\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.16.0-Beta d172dfd8a92f2d339f3d46a12a297e43e80768ca\n```\n\nmacOS version: Sequoia 15.1.1","files":null}]}
