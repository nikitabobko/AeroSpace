Maybe I'm not doing something correctly, but I'm trying to replicate i3 when the workspace is set to \"stacked\" layout. I also have this in my config per one of the suggestions:\n```\nafter-startup-command = [\n    'workspace 2', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 3', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 4', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 5', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 6', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 7', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 8', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 9', 'layout v_accordion',\n    'workspace 1', 'layout v_accordion'\n]\n```","files":null}]}
