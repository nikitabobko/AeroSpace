This makes switching workspaces and doing operations extremely slow (several seconds of delay) because the app waits for Unity to resize into the corner (or come back out).\n\nIt would be great if there could be an option for windows not in the active workspace to be hidden cmd+h style rather than be made smaller and pushed to the corner. This will make it faster to hide and re-open them when transitioning workspaces.\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
