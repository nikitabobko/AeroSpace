This would not only help in settings where you're testing different configs (directly running the `AeroSpace` binary in the app bundle to test configs for example, though I realize the intended way to do this is probably to hot reload the config as you make changes).\n\nIn my very narrow use case, this would also allow system management tools that manage available packages and launchd services to keep the AeroSpace launchd agent in sync with the available app bundle. I use Nix and `nix-darwin` to manage my hosts, and `yabai` provides the `-c` flag to specify the target config - this allows me to keep the launchd service in sync with the provided binary and config.\n\nFor example, one could specify a config file outside of the two allowed config locations AeroSpace currently provides:\n\n`AeroSpace.app/Content/MacOS/AeroSpace --running-at-start -c /etc/aerospace.toml`","files":null}]}
