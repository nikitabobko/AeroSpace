Often, many of my contexts, such as \"coding\" or \"messaging\" will involve the use of a browser window.\n\nI was thinking, it'd be cool if I could share the _same_ browser window between multiple workspaces. This would allow me to switch back and forth between contexts, but not lose any in-progress information inside my browser.\n\nIs something like this possible with AeroSpace?","files":null}]}
