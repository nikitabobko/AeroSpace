It’s made navigating macOS feel intuitive, and I just wish I’d tried it sooner. This minor issue is the only thing holding back my workflow.\n\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1729787737,"nonce":"3XyIZAi9bRa3yGnK6bFeqZD3OyQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6RLqip","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/613#issuecomment-2435754153"},"message":"This appears to be resolved by disabling \"displays have separate spaces\".","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1729787737,"nonce":"GIZXGwE1KN4p/E22HuadVfBcin4=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6bsOfJzwAAAAN1br9D"},"status":2}]}
