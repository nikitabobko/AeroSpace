I have the mental model in mind on how to support dynamic twm - #260 but the current proposal doesn't support what you want\n\n**Another option.** Once `tree` CLI command is supported #16 (and maybe `on-focus-changed` #230), you could try to script your desired workflow yourself\n\n**My personal opinion.** Treating applications in some special way during window layout is wrong. Window managers should work with \"window\" objects, not \"application\" objects. It's well known that people don't like `cmd+tab` in macOS because it works with \"apps\" not \"windows\"","files":null}]}
