Only one Terminal icon will be in the Dock at all times.\n2. If you check 'Command Key' visibility in the title by going to Terminal-\u003eSettings-\u003eProfiles-\u003eWindow-\u003eTitle, you'll be able to jump between Terminal windows, even in a tabbed or stacked layout, by using the keyboard shortcut ⌥⌘N, where N is the Terminal number.\n\nThe disadvantage is that you now have ugly AppleScript within the config.\n\n\ni3 has the script i3-sensible-terminal to launch a terminal based on what is defined in $TERMINAL and I think aerospace would benefit to have this feature as well.\n\nYou could hide the details of opening Terminal with AppleScript inside of it and the example config would then simplify to:\n\nalt-enter = 'exec-and-forget aerospace-sensible-terminal'","files":null}]}
