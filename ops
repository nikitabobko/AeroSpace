It's broken,\n2. I have the wrong expectation for how it should work, or\n3. the key combo I used is getting routed to some other software (e.g. I was running Yabai+skhd as well as Rectangle when I first launched Aerospace).\n\nWould it be possible for Aerospace to log the key combos it receives? This would at least help me rule out #3.","files":null}]}
