After alacritty is focused, trying to switch workspaces a second time will succeed. This behavior seems to be fairly robust against different layouts or how many windows I have open on each workspace.\n\nNote that I'm opening the terminals with:\n\n```bash\nalt-enter = 'exec-and-forget alacritty msg create-window || open -na alacritty'\n```\n\nso all of the terminal windows correspond to one instance of the app.\n\nSide note: opening alacritty with a stack layout will not focus it or place it in the foreground; this behavior is similar to #88.","files":null}]}
