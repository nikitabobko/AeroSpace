The MacOS menubar is configured to autohide. Windows that are on this external primary display are on top of sketchybar so that it isn't visible anymore. If I open an empty workspace I can see that it is there.\n\nThis does not happen on the main display, windows are sized in a way where sketchybar is visible.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can provide that would help with understanding this and thank you for making aerospace!","files":null}]}
