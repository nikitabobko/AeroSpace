For example\n\u003e \n\u003e alt-q = 'workspace ●○○○'\n\u003e alt-w = 'workspace ○●○○'\n\u003e alt-e = 'workspace ○○●○'\n\u003e alt-r = 'workspace ○○○●'\n\u003e alt-cmd-q = 'move-node-to-workspace ●○○○'\n\u003e alt-cmd-w = 'move-node-to-workspace ○●○○'\n\u003e alt-cmd-r = 'move-node-to-workspace ○○●○'\n\u003e alt-cmd-e = 'move-node-to-workspace ○○○●'\n\u003e would give you a text ui of dots. Not saying this is peak customization, but if you can forgo the clicking part, this is pretty nice already.\n\nIt's great for a single monitor, but I want a different appearance on each monitor in a multi-monitor setup. Currently, your solution looks like this: *●○○○|○●○○.","files":null}]}
