When switching from the accordion layout to the other layout containing the tiles, the accordion layout is not rendering properly. Instead only the tile being focused is rendered, while the rest of the window is still displaying the previous layout. I know this can be confusing, so I am certain the video will help understanding the issue I am facing, if it's an issue to begin with. I do remember on i3, this wasn't the case but it's been many years since I have used it.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb61e3a-e81c-4165-8004-34e3577d4c8c\n\n\n**Related issues you could find**\nI went through all the issues and to the best of my ability, I couldn't find anything similar.","files":null}]}
