One big thing that holds us back is the feature interaction with `reload-config` command.\n\nShall the `reload-config` override `config --set` or not? I don't like either of the answers. A more fundamental question is what is the source of truth? Right now, the answer is simple - the config is the only source of truth. And it's a good and convenient property.\n\nNevertheless, you have a workaround to patch the config with `sed` and call `reload-config`. That could be your \"the automation script\"","files":null}]}
