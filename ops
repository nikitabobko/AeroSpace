Basically, I want SketchyBar to be able to react when I change focus between windows (not just change workspaces, as Aerospace's demo shows). I found that the exec-on-workspace-change actually gets called per-window, not just per workspace, which is great. However, it doesn't get re-triggered when moving between different windows in the same app (e.g. i have multiple Chrome windows open). As far as I can tell, this basically prevents me from triggering a SketchyBar action to re-render my currently active window. I tried playing with Hammerspoon to get this trigger, but it just felt like a messy solution and I moved to Yabai. I'd love to come back to Aerospace if this is implemented, because I really hate disabling SIP.\n\nFor example, my SketchyBar looks like this: \n\n\u003cimg width=\"269\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-11 at 2 46 13â€¯AM\" src=\"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/8430991/64293c85-3288-4933-be81-4f0d33872415\"\u003e\n\nWhen I cycle focus from right to left, it never triggers the exec-on-workspace-change callback for the first 2 chrome windows.\n\nThe behavior I found seems accidental and doesn't really fit the callback's name, so I guess my feature request would be more callbacks for window/focus state. :) \n\nI'm on AeroSpace 0.8.2, MacOS Sonoma 14.3.","files":null}]}
