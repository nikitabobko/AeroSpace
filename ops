Since I am not allowed to disable SIP on my working computer I checked out Aerospace which is such a pleasure to read through the docs. Thanks for this amazing work.\n\nI love having dedicated boundary actions in your the aerospace config. In Yabai I had to set them up with [|| operators](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/278) which works fine: when I come to the right boundary of my workspace and there is no next window to focus my WM focuses the next workspace. Same for upper direction: if there is no upper window it focusses the next monitor. I love this feature and want to suggest additional boundary actions for the use case mentioned above.\n\n```\nfocus (left|right) --boundaries workspace --boundary-action workspace (prev|next)\nfocus (down|up) --boundaries all-monitors-outer-frame --boundary-action focus-monitor (prev|next)\n```\n\nI have read many issues and could not find a solution for this even though I found many others. I started with Aerospace in the morning and brought it pretty far with docs + this repo. \n\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\n```","files":null}]}
