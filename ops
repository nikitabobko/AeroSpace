I'd like to be able to leave the app running in fullscreen mode and still be able to use my shortcuts to switch to other workspaces at least on the other monitors, but it would be brilliant if I could switch workspaces even on the monitor that the app is running fullscreen on.\n\nIs this a bug or a feature request or [PEBKAC](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PEBKAC)?\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
