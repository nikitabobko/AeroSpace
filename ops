I donâ€™t think there is a way of achieving this right now?\n\nAs for what the command should look like, when I initially wanted to check if there was a command for this I first looked at the [query commands section](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#query-commands). I really like the `list-*` sub commands, so I think `aerospace list-modes --current` or `aerospace list-modes --active` would be most intuitive to me. `aerospace mode --show-current` would also work, and maybe be more in line with `aerospace config`?","files":null}]}
