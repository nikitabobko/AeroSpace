(The wrong monitor's menubar is highlighted, ⌘␣ will open windows on the wrong monitor, etc.)\n\nThis is also the case when using `workspace x` to focus on a particular monitor, however I don't have any issues with applications opening on the wrong monitor. I've tested using spotlight and raycast (which is what I daily drive) and those work as expected even when the menubar isn't highlighted correctly. I also tested using `workspace x` and also `focus-monitor right` with no applications on my secondary monitor and applications still open up on whatever monitor is focused in aerospace (ie. the asterisked workspace in the menubar)\n\n![CleanShot 2024-10-09 at 08 06 58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498d35e2-dd24-49af-b918-358076b3740d)","files":null}]}
