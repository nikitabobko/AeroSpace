It would be good if aerospace was able to remember the previous workspace(s) that were displayed and put them on the monitor that a workspace was just moved from.\n\nIt may need some additional logic like not moving workspaces that are already active on other monitors to prevent stealing workspaces from them.","files":null}]}
