Alternative names could be `next`/`previous`.\n\nFeatures:\n- allows for movements using one/two directional keys instead of four\n- requires significantly fewer actions in certain cases\n- is unambiguous, as in its behaviour does not change based on the focus cache.\n\nExample:\n```\nh_tiles\n├── window_1 (focused)\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window_2 (prev. focused)\n    └── window_3\n```\n\nnavigating to `window_3` in this case requires two actions,  `right` which would take you to `window_2` followed by `down`. This could have been done using a single ccw action.","files":null}]}
