It's my first time using a TWM and I can already feel the productivity boost!\n\nI have the following monitor arrangement which I believe meets the guidelines [here](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement):\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda7c1e3-cbd4-4070-ad7f-49cbaf2d9588)\n\nThe issue is that non-active workspace windows on my center monitor are being placed in the bottom right corner and are showing up along the bottom of the right monitor. If I'm not mistaken, they should be placed in the bottom left corner of the center monitor, since it hangs below the left monitor there.\n\nScreenshot from right monitor (the WezTerm window is in a workspace on my middle monitor, but I switched off that workspace):\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2abc2221-f702-4779-ad05-c9cc8c0a38a2)\n\nMy config is basically the default with a couple of tweaked keybinds and `on-window-detected` callbacks, so I don't believe it's a configuration issue.\n\nSo my main question is \"why is AeroSpace choosing the bottom right corner when the bottom left is the better choice?\", and/or is there a way to force it to use a particular corner?\n\nPlease let me know if any other information would be helpful to provide!\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
