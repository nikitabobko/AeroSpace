Congrats for the work, it is amazing! I had a moment of joy when moved the focus to different workspaces without any delay and animation :) \n\nMy question: I understand that by using Aerospace, the idea is that I will (probably) have a single space, and multiple workspaces. Is there a way to have a distinct wallpaper per workspace? Or all workspaces will need to have the same wallpaper?\n\nThe use case here is that I don't use menubar. My menubar is just date/clock. And for a few spaces I use different backgrounds so I know where I am.","files":null}]}
