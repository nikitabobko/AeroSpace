See the docs: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide.html#tree\n\n\u003e My monitor was vertically split into two panes, but on one side, it was like there was 3 windows in one pane stacked over each another (I could only see one at a time) and I could cycle them using option+shift+[j|k]\n\nA screenshot could be helpful but what you describe sounds like this layout:\n```\nv_tiles\n  h_tiles\n    window1\n    window2\n  h_tiles\n    window1\n    window2\n```\n\nWhat version do you run? I had some the logic to arrange windows on startup in the layout described above, but I changed it in later versions to arrange windows that way:\n```\nh_accordion\n  window1\n  window2\n  window3\n  window4\n```","files":null}]}
