My two main, external displays aren't HiDPI displays, so moving windows ... is janky. They flicker and also _sometimes_ it won't even snap to the correct workspace.\n\nIt is sufficiently frustrating that I went through the code to try to find if I could make this change myself. I believe that [this is the relevant line](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/37e253db75f69b0c94d2781d3662ac14759a97da/Sources/AppBundle/tree/MacWindow.swift#L113) where the modification would need to be made -- we would need to set the \"top left\" of the window to be the \"bottom right\" of the _current_ monitor.\n\nMy problem is that I don't know Objective-C at all, so I'm really wandering in the dark here.\n\nAs one potential fix, I could try to move my Mac to the left of my desk. Will just require unbolting my monitor stands and stuff which would not be ideal.\n\nAnother potential fix would be to move the windows to the bottom right of the \"main\" display (non-HiDPI display). I can live with the flickering on my Mac display since it's basically just for Spotify. But flipping between my IDE and Browser is very annoying lol.\n\nIf you have any advice, let me know. I really love AeroSpace and it has made my Mac experience wayyy better! Thank you so much.","files":null}]}
