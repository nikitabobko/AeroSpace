I would like to add the capability to use a specific window, which might not even be in the current workspace. \n\nThe main use case that I have is that I can quickly implement a quick query in a program like Alfred or similar and be able to bring a window from a different workspace to the current one.\n\nI appreciate the consideration!\n\n## Checklist\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
