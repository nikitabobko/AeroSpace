However, in some international layouts Option is used to write accented letters (e.g. Ō, Ł). It would be great if there was an option to differentiate between left and right Option key, and match bindings only with one of them, passing the unmatched ones to the OS for default handling.\n\nNote: I am using 0.5 beta.","files":null}]}
