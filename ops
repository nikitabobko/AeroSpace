I can see now why Aerospace use it's own method, it is indeed the most consistent.\n\n\u003e which so far looks identical to the private API that sketchybar uses\n\nThe NSScreen also puts the main monitor as first? If not, I would advise that sketchybar does it as reported earlier in this issue. Just mentioning it because you've mentioned the sketchybar in the docs in this commit\n\n\u003e If you want stronger guarantees please reach out to sketchybar developer for a feature request to expose/interpret monitor IDs accessible via public API or at least predictably stable order\n\nSeems fair enough and I agree with the decision\n\n\u003e Or, as it was mentioned, deviceDescription[NSDeviceDescriptionKey(\"NSScreenNumber\")] is also a good alternative (the returned number is funky, but at least it's documented)\n\nWas it also implemented in this Aerospace by this commit? I couldn't find a reference\n\n---\n\nThank you so much for effort and sorry if I gave any misleading information from `displayID`, I was just exploring things trying to find some common value that could be used as an anchor between different tools. ðŸ˜„","files":null}]}
