If I focus to the right then the left-most window will be focused:\n\n| x | _ | _ |\n\nThis wrap behavior is a little confusing when shuffling windows. I'd much rather the focus right do nothing as if it reach the end of the set of windows. This way I can quickly move to the beginning or end of some accordion or tile layout.\n\nA config to disable this sort of wrapping behavior would be really useful for my setup.","files":null}]}
