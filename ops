Open an application (e.g. Firefox) on the `workspace 1` (primary monitor)\n2. Open another window of the same application in `workspace 10` (secondary monitor)\n3. Open another application (e.g. Terminal) on the `workspace 2` (primary monitor)\n4. Switch to `workspace 1` (e.g. type `cmd-1`)\n5. Switch to `workspace 2` (e.g. type `cmd-1`)\n6. Switch to `workspace 1` I need your GD account to start enabling the rest of the permissions\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWindow on `workspace 1` is focused\n\n### Current behavior\n\nWindow on `workspace 10` is focused, even though I focused `workspace 1`\n\n### Workaround\n\nBy focusing `workspace 1` again (e.g. typing `cmd-1` twice) the correct window gets focus.\n\n## System information\n\n```\nOS: macOS 14.1.2 23B2091 arm64\nHost: Mac15,6\nKernel: 23.1.0\nUptime: 38 days, 4 hours, 16 mins\nPackages: 158 (brew)\nShell: zsh 5.9\nResolution: 1920x1080, 1512x982\nDE: Aqua\nWM: Quartz Compositor\nWM Theme: Purple (Dark)\nTerminal: tmux\nCPU: Apple M3 Pro\nGPU: Apple M3 Pro\nMemory: 3408MiB / 18432MiB\n```\n\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.10.0-Beta 4fe8276262b8df077ffface84c3f93f1b832b8ac\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.10.0-Beta 4fe8276262b8df077ffface84c3f93f1b832b8ac\n```","files":null}]}
