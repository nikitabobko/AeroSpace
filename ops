But I stumbled upon the following design problem:\n\n```\naerospace reload-config --path /custom/path/to/aerospace.toml\n\n# Shall the second invocation of reload-config read the config from default location\n# or keep reading it from the custom location?\naerospace reload-config\n```\n\nSurely, two flags can be introduced: `--persistent-config-path` and `--one-time-config-path`, but I'm afraid of unnecessary complications, and would love to get on only with a single flag if possible. What would be your preferred option and why?\n\n---\n\nI also noticed that you interact with AeroSpace.app server directly. I've not considered the server CLI as an API entry point. `--started-at-login` is an internal implementation detail. At least for now. (I assume that you meant `--started-at-login` instead of `--running-at-start`. `--running-at-start` is not an existing flag)\n\nI'm curious to learn more about your use case. I don't know a lot about nix and nix-darwin. All I know is how nix stores the packages to achieve better dependency control. Is AeroSpace installed via Nix, so that's why you have to interact with AeroSpace.app directly?","files":null}]}
