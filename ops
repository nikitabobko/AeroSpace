To be more accurate, if I open Discord while I'm in Safari, it will consider Discord window as new Safari window and move it according to my another rule of Safari windows.\n\nSame thing happens to my another application Mattermost, which is a Slack-like app (I don't want to get to the details here). \n\nI don't know what are the similarity between Discord and Mattermost. I thought it may be because they are both Electron apps, but my other Electron apps are fine with AeroSpace.\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.apple.Safari'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'\n\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'com.hnc.Discord'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace Q'\n\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'Mattermost.Desktop'\nrun = 'move-node-to-workspace Q'\n```\n\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
