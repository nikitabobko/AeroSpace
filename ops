Commands \"focus left|right|up|down\" stop when they reach the boundary.  So users forced to have four keybindings instead of one and should think where they should go. In Emacs I have \"alt-o\" mapped to \"other-window\" and pressing it several times until I end up in the desired window (I rarely have more than 3) is so much better.  I want to have similar binding in AeroSpace mapped to the same key, so \"alt-h, j, k, l\" are free.\n\nThe implementation might be DFS over the window tree.\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
