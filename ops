Some time later, I (co-incidentally) ran `brew leaves` and found `skhd` still installed. I think `skhd` was intercepting my key-presses, and happened to not load before Aerospace this time around. Maybe this is true for others as well (I used Yabai before Aerospace and it needed skhd to handle keyboard shortcuts).","files":null}]}
