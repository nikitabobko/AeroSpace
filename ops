This will at least show what aerospace has processed as usable workspaces from your config file.\n\n`aerospace list-workspaces --all`\n\nYou should be able to remove default workspaces (for example a-z) by commenting out the \"alt-1 = 'workspace 1'\" lines in your aerospace.toml (you may also need to comment out the \"move-node-to-workspace\" lines as well). I've disabled all of the letter workspaces in my config, and now all that show up automatically are the numbered workspaces (which is what i wanted).\n\nCan you post what you have configured?","files":null}]}
