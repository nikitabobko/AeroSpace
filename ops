And you could do zero actions with Aerospace.\n\nThis happend because IntelliJ somehow also got stuck and had to be force-quit. I even restarted Aerospace (while IntelliJ was still in its broken state) and Aerospace was barely responsive only resizing some windows, switching workplaces didn't work at all.\n\nOnly fully force quitting IntelliJ brought life back to Aerospace.","files":null}]}
