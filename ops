It will last until I write one more script. On my machine, I replaced BSD with GNU https://gist.github.com/skyzyx/3438280b18e4f7c490db8a2a2ca0b9da, and I don't care about BSD\n\n- One option I see is to mention that building the release version may require GNU tools in the document you want to write.\n- Another option could be to build the release version on CI for testing that BSD build is not broken. But the problem is that we need to set some team ID on GH actions. I don't want to share my private signature with GH actions. Maybe GH actions has some built-in team ID. If it doesn't then I don't see how it can be done (but I didn't think it thoroughly)\n\n\u003e I guess it would be nice if the team ID could be set with an environment variable.\n\nIf xcodegen can do that, it would be nice\n\n\u003e If you want I can create a PR with my proposed changes and add some documentation\n\nIt'd be nice, thanks! I'd extract it into a separate document like `docs/development.md` and mention it in the readme. \"How to build the project\" and \"How to run the tests\" sections of the readme can be moved to the newly introduced document\n\n---\n\nI'm curious: if it's for testing, why building the debug version didn't work for you? `run-debug.sh` would do the trick. The debug is built on GH actions, so it's checked that it is compatible with BSD","files":null}]}
