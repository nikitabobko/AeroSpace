Somehow aiding in this process would be very practical _imo_. Identifying the currently focused window is necessary to perform: `move`, `join-with`, `layout`, `focus`, `resize`.\n\nI know this goes against the current value-statement of the project, but I'd like to open the discussion anyway because IMO this is not merely a question of fancy appearance.\n\u003e Provide practical features. Fancy appearance features are not practical (e.g. window borders, transparency, etc)\n\n---\n### Workaround\nI've currently added Hammerspoon which provides this functionality, but since it does not integrate with AeroSpace, there's noticeable delays for the overlay to refresh when changing focused window.","files":null}]}
