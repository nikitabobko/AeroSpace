When i create a new tab in my mac terminal app the whole terminal window gets repositioned to the position a new window would take if it would been created.\n\n\nSo from a full screen terminal (1 tab) when i open a tab goes to a half screen (positioned to right) terminal (2 tabs). If i keep adding tabs then the space keeps getting smaller and smaller.\n\nHere is a video of the bug https://youtu.be/nWSoh7fZF8o\n\n**Related issues you could find**\nfound this https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/517 but there is no comments, marked as solved. I tried upgrading aerospace to latest but that didnt fix the bug either.","files":null}]}
