I submitted a feature request on their forum to possibly have a way to act as a simple Mac app. Not only would I like that as a feature, but it might fix things with Aerospace.\n\nStill, it could be indicative of a bug in Aerospace, or perhaps some window APIs you'd like to support. The issues I have been consistently facing with Orion are:\n\n- Navigation to an Orion window with Aerospace's \"focus \u003cdirection\u003e\" has a 50% chance of bouncing you back to your first window\n- Navigation to an Orion window with Aerospace's \"focus \u003cdirection\u003e\" has a 25% chance of skipping the Orion window and going past it\n- Navigation to an Orion window via the macOS app launcher will fail\n- Navigation to an Orion window via clicking on the dock has a 90% success rate, but will occasionally crash aerospace\n\nThe discussion on their board can be found here: https://orionfeedback.org/d/9898-disable-custom-window-behavior\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I have had the occasional perhaps related issue a few times with IINA - the only other app I use that tries to treat every window as a separate app in `⌘ tab`. I do not use IINA enough though to really be able to say anything with confidence, it's more of a hunch.\n\nUnfortunately, if I just open Orion in a split with another app, navigation between them works fine. However in practice, it consistently fails.\n\nLike I said in the link, I'm not excepting any magic :) both such amazing products, and I can't imagine this crossover being high on anyone's priority list.","files":null}]}
