So with ALT-h only, I switched from Wezterm to Arc and so on.\nAfter a while, I changed the direction and changing focus from left to right. So with ALT-L only, I switched from Arc to Wezterm and so on.\nAnd then the weird behavior appears. When changing the focus from Arc (on the left) to Wezterm (on the right) with ALT-L, Arc is pulsing. And when I use ALT-L again to change focus from Wezterm to Arc, Wezterm is changing position for a short time.\n\nI am using the latest Verion of OSX: Sequoia 15.0.1\n\nI already reinstalled Aerospace again, but encounter the same behavior.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3618f0ab-61d4-4e82-94cb-43d47f142c3c\n\n\n## Checklist\n- [ x] I've searched for duplicates.
