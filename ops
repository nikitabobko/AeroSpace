However, looking at a fullscreen window, there is no indication AFAICT that I am looking at a window in fullscreen mode as opposed to a workspace with only a single window.\n\nIs there a way to give the user some indication that they are in fullscreen mode? Perhaps something like service mode where the menu bar goes from `1` to `[s] 1`?","files":null}]}
