Have Calendar and another application open\n2. Create a new Calendar event, start typing in the title\n3. Observe what happens after a few keystrokes\n\n**Expected result**\nThe pop-up stays in focus and you can finish the event\n\n**Actual result**\nThe pop-up is unfocused, and the next available window is selected.\n\n_Originally posted by @hiddekramermusic in https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/1219_","files":null}]}
