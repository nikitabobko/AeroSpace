I would appreciate a way to configure font used to render the workspace.\n\nWhy:  I often switch between `1` and `2` workspaces and `1` is narrowed than `2`.  So rest of the icons in the tray menu jump shift slightly left or right.  It is not a deal breaker, but it is noticeable and somewhat irritating.  Setting the font to some monospaced font would solve the issue.","files":null}]}
