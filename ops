I've tried both Amethyst and Yabai - uninstalled them immediately after trying Aerospace. After using this for a while, I don't even understand why this is not default for ALL computers out there.\n\nThat said, I am doing something similar to your suggestion by using a custom mode:\n```\n[mode.mm.binding]\nesc = ['reload-config', 'mode main']\nb = ['workspace 0', 'workspace B', 'mode main']\nm = ['workspace 9', 'workspace M', 'mode main']\n...\n```\n\nWhich isn't half bad, since I still have the flexibility of changing individual workspace, but I still, at specific moments, have a want for the ability to group the *currently visible* workspaces together.\n\nBut at the same time I can understand why you may think this is redundant and lacks actual utility since Aerospace is about flexibility, and adding something will make it more rigid in a way.\n\nThe custom mode method is about 98% working for me, so I'll just close this FR.\n\nThanks again!","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1724890495,"nonce":"nv4GHZS0495IU21PZxgO38TnGyg=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6UJiz-zwAAAANFsFZm"},"status":2},{"type":3,"timestamp":1724890853,"nonce":"fcgQl0mxfFqW204Q6pwH3FbFERM=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6KEpRY","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/454#issuecomment-2316473432"},"message":"Oh, one thing I forgot to mention:\n\nTwo things that are not quite right with this method are:\n- Invoking two workspaces instead of one means that focus will be on the workspace that is at the end of the list\n- `workspace-back-and-forth` does not invoke the \"group\" of workspaces, but just the last workspace used, so it can become a bit fatiguing having to go back-and-forth with the custom mode commands.","files":null}]}
