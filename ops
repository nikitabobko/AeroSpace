I also took inspiration from that script and did something similar (except I call my workspace NSP like xmonad). I didn't think of the `aerospace move-mouse window-lazy-center` like your script. Pretty neat. Thanks for attaching it here. \n\n Did you find a way to get the flickering (from workspace switching) to go away?","files":null}]}
