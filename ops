I tried moving them using `[move-workspace-to-display](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/docs/commands.md#move-workspace-to-display)` but it's hard to end up with the correct workspace number on the wanted monitor. \n\nFor example, on i3 I would set:  \n\n```\n# Location of workspaces \nworkspace $ws1 output $monitorA\nworkspace $ws2 output $monitorA\nworkspace $ws3 output $monitorB\nworkspace $ws4 output $monitorB\n```\n\nIs it possible to assign workspaces to monitors?","files":null}]}
