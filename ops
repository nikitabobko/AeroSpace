I've gone through 3 updates by now and the only thing I had to do was quit aerospace and re-open it. \n\nI installed it initially with `--no-quarantine` flag but from that point on all I ever do is `brew update \u0026\u0026 brew upgrade -g`. I don't have any env flags set in my `zsh` config for homebrew either.","files":null}]}
