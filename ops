It won't work because:\n1. If monitors have different resolutions, it will be a performance disaster #149 \n2. Some apps may not like to be often moved between monitors (like chrome: #289)\n3. If AeroSpace crashes, users will loose windows on the invisible monitor\n4. I don't like providing config options for choosing between different trade-offs\n5. To my taste, a \"virtual monitor\" hack is just intuitively too much invasive to be reliable, there might be other problems","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1728506094,"nonce":"wB8i7i4w1tblNQid/Mf3s41FKhQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6Zkne4zwAAAANk_nqj"},"status":2}]}
