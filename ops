This option would make the command behave like if `\u003cwindow-id\u003e` was focused\n\nMotivation: \n- Under the hood `--window-id` is already presented. That's how `on-window-detected.run` is implemented. We could make it more transparent by saying in the docs that `--window-id` is applied by default to all of the `on-window-detected.run` commands. #20 \n- It's another way to fix #173 . We could say that if no args were passed to `focus` command then we force focus the current window. This way focusing the window by id becomes `aerospace --window-id \u003cID\u003e focus`\n\n**(2)** Add `--no-follow-focus` to `move` and `--follow-focus` to `move-node-to-workspace` commands (btw, it's inconsistent that `move` follows focus by default, but `move-node-to-workspace` doesn't).\n\nMotivation: \n- It makes scripting easier. Yes, it's possible to write `aerospace move-node-to-workspace \u003cworkspace\u003e \u0026\u0026 aerospace workspace \u003cworkspace\u003e`, but it gets more problematic when `move-node-to-workspace` is invoked by `xargs`. \"Follow focus\" is quite a common use case, it would be nice to have a flag for it.\n- We could lift the second limitation from #20 by saying that `--follow-focus` is applied by default to `move-node-to-workspace `\n\n**(3)** Add `--format window-id` (or `--window-id-only`) to `list-windows` command. \n\nMotivation: It's tedious and error-prone to write `aerospace list-windows | awk '{print $1}'`. \n\nIn the same way, `--format monitor-id` (or `--monitor-id-only`) can be added to `list-monitors` command\n\n---\n\nMotivation for all 3 flags:\n\n**(a)** Move all windows to the current workspace #185:\n```\nfocused=$(aerospace list-workspaces --focused)\naerospace list-windows --all --format window-id | xargs -n1 aerospace move-node-to-workspace $focused --follow-focus --window-id\n```","files":null}]}
