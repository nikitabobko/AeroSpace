For this I would need to be notified when a window was opened or closed. Currently we only have an event when a workspace was changed which is not enough.\n\u003e \n\u003e Let's say you just closed the last firefox windows in a last \"F\" workspace. Technically you are still in it, no \"workspace\" changed event was triggered, no way to remove \"firefox\" app from the \"F\" workspace.\n\u003e \n\u003e Maybe aerospace could implement custom events via NSDistributedNotificationCenter: https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/events#creating-custom-events for a various of actions:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Windows added / removed from the workspace\n\u003e * Workspace added/removed\n\ni just use \"on-focus-changed\" \ngood enough for me\n\n like so\nhttps://github.com/agenttank/dotfiles_macos/blob/main/aerospace/aerospace.toml","files":null}]}
