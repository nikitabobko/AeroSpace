I can still cycle to it with focus command but no other commands seem to do anything to the window.  Happens a lot with sublime windows and brave (or chrome) windows.  Could be related to this but I find it's not fully just related to dragging a new tab (def not in the case of sublime) - https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1001","files":null}]}
