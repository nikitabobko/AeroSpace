I've been testing it since tonight and I'm really enjoying it so far, I already prefer it over my yabai setup.\n\nThe only thing I'm missing from my i3 setup is the ability to move between adjacent workspaces with a single key which is possible in i3 using workspace next | prev, https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces. Would be nice if that was available, then my setup would be complete.","files":null}]}
