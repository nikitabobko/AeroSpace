To completely replicate dynamic tiling window managers, it should be possible to change normalizations with command on per-workspace basis\n\nNormalizations to consider:\n- `floating`. All windows on the workspace are floating. \n  Open question: should the normalization remember and restore layout from the workspace where this normalization wasn't enabled?\n- `columns`\n- `rows`\n- `primay-others` (\"tall\" in Amethyst)\n- `others-primary` (\"tall-right\" in Amethyst)\n- `v-primary-others` (\"wide\" in Amethyst)\n- `v-others-primary`\n\nTo consider: file with declarative hierarchical normalization description (something like yaml, but probably not yaml)\n\nRelated: #228 #248","files":null}]}
