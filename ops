After about one day I'm pretty sure I'm a convert. Brilliant work @nikitabobko!\n\nThat said, I have a question regarding `gaps.outer.top`. It seems that on the display with a \"notch\", the padding is in relation to the bottom of the notch. Whereas displays without a notch, the padding is in relation to the actual top of the display. This makes the gap between the top of a window and my bar (SketchyBar) drastically larger/smaller on each display. Is there any way to account for this (eg. display specific setting)?\n\nMaybe a screenshot will help illustrate better than my description. The left side is my MacBook Pro and the right is my external.\n\n![CleanShot 2023-12-29 at 18 24 53@2x](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/184915/1306976a-1a15-44ac-8e5f-38318cc569a4)","files":null}]}
