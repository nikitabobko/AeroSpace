But normally, move-node-to-workspace doesn't have \"focus following\" behavior \n\nThe reason on why it works this way is actually not because move-node-to-workspace has \"focus following\" inside the callback, but because newly appeared window steals the focus from AeroSpace.\n\nIt's an implementation coincidence that AeroSpace firstly runs the callback and then checks if the focus was stolen by macOS.\n\nBut it's an implementation coincidence that I'm not going to change, because it's a good naive expected behavior, which too many people already rely on","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1724595836,"nonce":"jIIuGDsEgNjqdIMJbAvynyGcdUk=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6T89ljzwAAAANCuwiZ"},"added":["doesnt-make-sense"],"removed":[]}]}
