From your list I see the ones we had in common are Raycast and skhd, although skhd I had already uninstalled. So I would suggest disabling Raycast (or everything) and rebooting to see if it that helps.\n\n—\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub \u003chttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/514#issuecomment-2371822155\u003e, or unsubscribe \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADZPRL27SABZQ4JOL4LT2ITZYGJ7RAVCNFSM6AAAAABOJY423GVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43OSLTON2WKQ3PNVWWK3TUHMZDGNZRHAZDEMJVGU\u003e.\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.","files":null}]}
