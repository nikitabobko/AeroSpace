So far everything works perfect.\n\nNow launch any other app on monitor A, focus that app window. Then try to focus monitor B. We focus brower. Try to focus monitor B again. We focus monitor B.\n\nYou have to focus on the cloned window at first, then could make a move.\n\nI also tried run command on termianl to make a focus move. Same.\n\nIt's fine if I just use one monitor. I can focus other desktop as usual even if I open browsers on every desktop.","files":null}]}
