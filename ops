I can test out the patch above, but I do see the suboptimality in behavior. \n\nI think a time-based solution / approximation could work really well actually, and flickering in my opinion is much better than the wrong workspace being focused on the other monitor (consider for example workflows where you're passively looking at terminals or something). \n\nLet me know if there's any help I can give on this, I can definitely test things out if you chose to make such a fix (I'm not familiar with swift to write a PR unfortunately). \n\nRegarding reliability, I get your point that behavior is consistent, but correct behavior from the user's perspective is more important (in my opinion) for a reliable user experience. Right now, it's difficult for me to trust that a workspace or window will be visible if I close a browser for example, and that makes it hard to rely on that particular feature of aerospace. \n\nIn general, this is a fantastic piece of software, with a very clever way to emulate workspaces, so definitely, thank you for making and maintaining this.","files":null}]}
