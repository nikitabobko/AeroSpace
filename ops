It's good to see people doing such investments. Very much appreciated! I didn't even know about the existance of JavaScriptCore in macOS SDK.\n\nHowever, right now, I don't plan to introduce any embedded scripting programming language.\n\nAeroSpace is not a framework like Hammerspoon. I want AeroSpace to be designed as \"ready to go\" solution. AeroSpace is optimized for specific workflows and adds just enough of extensibility. If users want something beyond, well - sorry. As a supportive argument I want to mention Helix vs Neovim approaches. I'm very much for Helix approach of all batteries included and sensible defaults.\n\nIf users want to do scripting, they should do it outside of the AeroSpace configuration in whatever users' favorite programming language. All AeroSpace query commands should support `--json` flag to make it easier to use commands from programming languages.\n\nAbout my suggestion in #278. I don't want it to be a programming language. Initially, I thought to only include `\u0026\u0026`, `|`, `||` and that's it. `on-window-detected` would look like:\n\n```toml\non-window-detected = '''\n    test %{app-bundle-id} == org.jetbrains.intellij \u0026\u0026 move-node-to-workspace I\n        || test %{app-bundle-id} == com.google.chrome \u0026\u0026 move-node-to-workspace W\n'''\n```\n\nbut then I realized the common gotcha https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2015, and it, unfortunatelly, made me think about the `if` syntax:\n\n```toml\non-window-detected = '''\n    if test %{app-bundle-id} == org.jetbrains.intellij do \n        move-node-to-workspace I\n    elif test %{app-bundle-id} == com.google.chrome do \n        move-node-to-workspace W\n    end\n'''\n```\n\nRegarding #60, I think the current go to solution is `max-width` suggested in the comments. I now discard my \"conditional gaps\" suggestion in favor of `max-width`.\n\nI'd very happy if we managed to simplify `on-window-detected` rather than complicating it with programming languages (no matter if it's an in-house language or general purpose language like Lua). I think that assigning windows to workspaces is inherently conditional, that's why it's hard to avoid viewing it like if-statements.","files":null}]}
