I see the hangs on many actions, but most prominently on moving a window to another workspace (e.g. `['move-node-to-workspace 1', 'workspace 1', 'move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']`) or even clicking the menubar item. Just running `aerospace list-windows --all` currently takes many seconds. \n\nI also tried 0.15.2; same problem. \n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\nNot sure if related to https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/131, but I don't have a particular large amount of data going on (5 workspaces, 3+2 across 2 monitors, and currently 10 windows). \n\nHere's a sample from Activity Monitor while this is going on: \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/incanus/1014ffd2c2b51e2cd45e507e3c3cb94b","files":null}]}
