However, it makes moving windows with a mouse / trackpad to another screen totally impossible and explodes the entire workspace.\n\nFrom the observed behavior it looks like, as soon as the moved window is reaching another screen, Aerospace somehow registers the focus changed event and tries to move the the mouse to the center of the window. Since the window is not yet placed on the monitor, its center is likely to be on another screen, thus, moving the mouse pointer back there and disrupting the drag before you have a chance to release the window.","files":null}]}
