I've managed to make it work, but the process still feels a bit clunky. I could really use a smoother solution.\n\n`cmd-shift-alt-down = \"exec-and-forget ~/.dotfiles/.aerospace/finder_move.sh\"`\n\n```#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -o errexit\nset -o nounset\nset -o pipefail\n\ncurrent_workspace=$(aerospace list-workspaces --focused)\n\nosascript -e \"\ntell application \\\"Finder\\\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\" \u0026\u0026 aerospace move-node-to-workspace \"$current_workspace\" \u0026\u0026 aerospace workspace \"$current_workspace\"```\n\n\n\nIs there a more efficient way to achieve this?
