As a sway user on the linux side of things, this is also how moving windows using `move \u003cdirection\u003e` work by default.\n\n\u003e If you can move the current window to the left in the current workspace, do it! Otherwise, move the window to the monitor in the left (wrapping around)\n\nWhen working on something requiring multiple monitors, the ability to think \"move this over there\" rather than \"move this to whatever workspace that monitor is currently on\" reduces the mental overhead, leaving more room for the task at hand. The ability to get out of the way like this is a great feat of a window manager like Aerospace.","files":null}]}
