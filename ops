Here is my settings:\n\u003cimg width=\"424\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19de8f0b-366b-4ebc-8b79-1ce177967a7b\"\u003e\n\nso I use raycast to open Arc, it move the arc window to workspace b for the first time created. And somehow out of habit, I will use raycast to hide Arc. \nAnd then I switch the focus to workspace t in another monitor for other purpose. (now arc is hidden, and I am focuing on workspace t)\nnow I use raycast to open Arc agian, this time I guess because Arc window is already created, `on-window-detected` will not trigger. So the Arc will be  added to the workspace t (another monitor). \nThis is not what I expected, because Arc window has changed to another workspace after reveal. \n\nCan we empower on-window-detected to support detection on the existing window when reveal, or add another callback like `on-window-reveal` to be able trigger commands to keep the window on certain workspace? \n\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
