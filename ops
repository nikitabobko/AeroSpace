I'm glad to see such contributions\n\n\u003e I don't know whether you'd like to mention in anywhere in the docs or so that I can contribute it the docs myself.\n\nI'm 100% for mentioning all the cool stuff around AeroSpace. There is a special page for it https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/goodness\n\nI've mentioned the extension in the docs https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/commit/22c958fb9a87b8a540559fbb2fef4f58e0cef983 \n\nFeel free to submit a PR if you prefer a different wording/advertisement\n\nIt will appear on the site when I rebuild the site\n\n---\n\n**Note 1.** I've left a few questions in the Raycast PR https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/12122\n\n**Note 2.** I notice that you parse the `~/.aerospace.toml` file by yourself in the extension (and users also need to manually pick the location of the file).\n\nWould the extension benefit from CLI commands that allow querying AeroSpace config state? I can introduce \"plumbing\" commands like `aerospace list-bindings --mode \u003cmode\u003e`, `aerospace list-modes`. The commands can be made to output the data in JSON format with `--json` flag for easier consumption by the extension\n\n**Note 3.** I notice that you try to run command by triggering the bindings with AppleScript. It's fragile and it didn't work on my machine:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"375\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/20517828/428fc5a7-c85a-4325-a2a6-a39de5942ee7\"\u003e\n\nI can introduce the CLI command to run aerospace commands by bindings. Like `aerospace trigger-binding alt-1`. Will it be possible for the extension to use those commands? WDYT?\n\n---\n\nAgain, thank you!","files":null}]}
