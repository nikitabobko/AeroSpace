Especially while using other tools like sketchybar for instance. Having those envs will reduce aerospace queries and will lower resource consumption.\n\nAdditionally, further environment variables would be useful. Some ideas that I have in my mind:\n\n`AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_MONITORID`: the current focussed monitor id\n`AEROSPACE_WORKSPACE_MONITORID`: the monitor id for the workspace\n`AEROSPACE_WORKSPACE_WINDOWS`: the windows in the workspace\n\nxref https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/230#issuecomment-2262997144","files":null}]}
