When I switch from workspace 1 to workspace 2, all the apps show up, start resizing for a second until the actual app open on that workspace stays fixed.\n\nThis seem to only happen on random occasions when I close and open my Mac sometimes.\n\nVideo of the bug:\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0215e74d-281e-4d16-8ac2-962dbc2caed3\n\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
