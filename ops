My workaround is this in the AeroSpace config:\n\n```\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = \"com.mitchellh.ghostty\"\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nrun = \"layout floating\"\n```\n\nReload the config, this needs to be in place **before** Ghostty is started (so if you just added it, reload the AeroSpace config and then restart Ghostty). It will then always start in floating mode, and when you unfloat it (`opt-shift-semicolon f` by default) everything works fine.\n\nThe key seems to be that it starts floating. If you start it normally, and then float and unfloat it does not work.","files":null}]}
