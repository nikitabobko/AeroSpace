Like: `workspace --auto-back-and-forth 1`. The downside will be that you need to mention the flag in all your `workspace` command usages in the config\n\nI don't want to introduce a global `workspace_auto_back_and_forth` flag that changes the behavior of all `workspace` commands because I think such a global flag is error-prone:\n1. It will make scripting for AeroSpace harder. Some scripts might expect that `workspace` command is idempotent\n2. Some users might want to follow the focus when a window is moved to a different workspace only for specific workspaces:\n    ```\n    # 'workspace 1' is used in an idempotent manner in 'alt-1' binding. \n    # Global auto-back-and-forth is error-prone\n    alt-1 = ['move-node-to-workspace 1', 'workspace 1']\n    alt-2 = 'workspace --auto-back-and-forth 2'\n    ```","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1702590071,"nonce":"MFWZb2BRgHJSdB9QEhWYcXGdCqM=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM549skCzwAAAAKevjQq"},"status":2},{"type":3,"timestamp":1702845327,"nonce":"me7/L9w4XdZk6pDm525LhEr84As=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5u0lBY","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/43#issuecomment-1859276888"},"message":"Released in 0.7.0-Beta","files":null}]}
