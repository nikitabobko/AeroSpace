Alternatively, be able to be assigned to all workspaces (like setting macOS Spaces\u003eAll); whichever paradigm is simpler. The outcome should be that **when one of these apps is switched to, they should appear on the current workspace rather than changing workspace**.\n\nThis also applies to apps that are modal like [kando-menu/kando: ðŸ¥§ The Cross-Platform Pie Menu.](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando?tab=readme-ov-file), which is mostly unusable with Aerospace. Calling a pie menu swaps to workspace 1.","files":null}]}
