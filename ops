I have a lot of Intellij Project open at the same time and used the \"Always open windows in Tabs\" which seems to be a very broken feature for WM's.\nIs there some way or workaround to group all IntelliJ windows in a vertical stack as if it is one window?\nI don't seem to be able to move the hole stack around as I would like.\n\nThanks for the great work üëç","files":null}]}
