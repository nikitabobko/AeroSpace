If I switch back to any of my actual workspaces, flameshot closes the overlay. Curiously the built-in macos screenshot tool overlay does work nicely - but it is nowhere near as good as Flameshot.\n\nI have default configs for both applications.\n\nAerospace verison (latest):\n```\n\u003e aerospace --version\n\naerospace CLI client version: 0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\n```\n\nFlameshot version:\n\n```\nFlameshot v12.1.0 (96c2c82e)\nCompiled with Qt 5.15.5\n```\n\nSorry if this is not the right forum for this type of issue; please feel free to close if this is not appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates - previous issue for a different problem with flameshot was resolved\n- [x] I've read the guide https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide\n- [x] I've searched in the documentation (https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide \u0026 https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands) for flameshot but found nothing.","files":null}]}
