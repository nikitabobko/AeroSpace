Usually when in a meeting, if the window wasn't on the active desktop, it would show a mini floating window. Now that it's always technically on the active desktop it doesn't show. However minimizing teams also shows this window. It's an extra step but perhaps this will also work for Arc?\n\nMinimising actually does not trigger, but changing tabs in the browser (to trigger the PiP in the other tab) and then switching to the intended workspace is the workaround that works.\n\nHowever I wonder if there is anything on the Aerospace side to mitigate this limitation, since its specifically related to the way it handles its own workspaces.","files":null}]}
