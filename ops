I know we would be quite close to the phantom holes you describe but we could write like \"App in Fullscreen\" on the placeholder window and move to the fullscreen \"space\" when it is clicked. \nSince I don't know the codebase of aerospace I don't know how feasible this is or if it just sounds stupid. And even if it's doable I see that it's a bit wonky but implementing this would greatly reduce the annoyance with fullscreens.","files":null}]}
