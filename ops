User opens 30 windows, and has them distributed in a particular way across 10 workspaces.\n2. AeroSpace is closed for some reason, and then re-opened.\n3. All 30 windows are on workspace 0.\n\nAt the least, can the associated workspace of each window be tracked in some persistent way (periodically saved, and saved when closing/crashing?), so that when AeroSpace is started again, all of these open windows can be re-assigned to the workspace they were last on?\n\nOr maybe there is already a way to do this that I'm unaware of?","files":null}]}
