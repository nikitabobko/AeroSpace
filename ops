Perhaps that is something that will die away over time, but specifically I think I am failing to get a workflow where I can have multiple accordians next to one another in a row. With I3 I could basically manage my workflow in a single workspace because of that depth of stacks/tabs.\n\nThat being said, this feels like a rabbit hole, because the other thing that i3 has that aerospace does not to make that whole workflow much more doable was the stack/tab UI. It allowed for visual hints about what was selected and what the current state of the tree is that isn't as possible with aerospace.","files":null}]}
