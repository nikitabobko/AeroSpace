Dragging floating windows between monitors was SUPER annoying cause they jumped back in 9/10 times. Only slow dragging worked sometimes.\nHowever disabling \"Displays have separate spaces\" (following the [instruction](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#a-note-on-displays-have-separate-spaces)) fixed the issue\n\nPS: don't forget to logout to apply the system changes","files":null}]}
