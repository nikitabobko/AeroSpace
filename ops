(in macOS, the menu is not within window borders) Once the mouse is moved out of the window border, the focus changes\n\nThat's an excellent question. Mac OS has the built-in ability to provide a shortcut to move focus to the menu bar (it appears the default is Ctl-F2). So how about either letting users rely on that, and disabling focus-follows-mouse while the menu bar is focused, or providing a built-in Aerospace command to open the menu bar and move the mouse to it (so that focus doesn't get lost on the way to the bar)?\n\n(I don't see this suggested above; sorry if I missed it.)","files":null}]}
