For instance, I'd like display my `b`, `m`, and `c` on each display by default when I connect to my external monitors at work, but aerospace will display workspaces `1`, `2`, and `3`. A display callback could let me focus these upon connection\n\nI also have a different monitor at home, and I'd like to configure some default tiling to trigger when that display is connected.","files":null}]}
