The first monitor is **always** the primary monitor.\nAeroSpaces first monitor is always the most left monitor, regardless if it's the primary monitor or not.\n\nThis makes it pretty hard to use `aerospace list-workspaces` and `aerospace --add event [...] display=$monitorID` for instance.\n\nIn my case I have the Macbook on the left side of the monitor -- where my external monitor is primary.\nRunning the following command will add all workspaces to the wrong monitor:\n\n```bash\nfor monitorID in $(aerospace list-monitors | awk '{print $1}'); do\n    for sid in $(aerospace list-workspaces --monitor $monitorID); do\n        sketchybar --add item \\\n            space.$sid left \\\n            display=$monitorID\n            # [...] and some more parameters\n    done\ndone\n```\n\nIMO it is worth the effort to give the users the ability to adjust the order. Something like an additional command to select if it will be ordered align to the X and Y axis or if we want to have the primary monitor always as the first one.","files":null}]}
