(in macOS, the menu is not within window borders) Once the mouse is moved out of the window border, the focus changes\n\nI'll rarely use the menu bar - I either use shortcuts or if make my window fullsize if I need it\n\n\u003e If the cursor is within the currently focused window bounds, and I change focus with keybinding. Then I slightly move the mouse keeping it within the previously focused window, should the window receive the focus back? Or does the focus change only once the mouse crosses borders?\n\nI use focus follows mouse + mouse follows focus in i3/sway/yabai, so the cursor moves to the center of the focused window if I use the keyboard to change focus.\n\n\u003e How floating windows should be handled? Are they prioritized over tiled windows? How to choose between several overlaping floating windows? It looks like macOS doesn't allow to check \"the stack\" of windows, so I can't just pick the most recent\n\nI don't know the solution to this one, but I would personally be fine with this working any way (or not) with floating windows as I don't mind clicking these.","files":null}]}
