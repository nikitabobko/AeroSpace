Since order cannot not be guaranteed at the parsing level, aerospace can't guarantee a \"default workspace\". Aerospace would have to use a different parser or some other mechanism to set a *hard* \"default workspace\" for every monitor.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1725356112,"nonce":"x68z6FgBMFkA0xIgH03OxOH/89A=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6SWCFVzwAAAANJJ74O"},"status":2}]}
