I'd suggest to add instructions to add `brew install coreutils` and maybe change the uses of `cp` with `gcp`.\n- after resolving that issue, running `build-release.sh` throws this error `/Users/matthias/AeroSpace/AeroSpace.xcodeproj: error: No signing certificate \"Mac Development\" found: No \"Mac Development\" signing certificate matching team ID \"4MWP47XA68\" with a private key was found. (in target 'AeroSpace' from project 'AeroSpace')` I guess it would be nice if the team ID could be set with an environment variable.\n\n\nAfter adjusting the team ID in the project.yml I was able to build the release. If you want I can create a PR with my proposed changes and add some documentation.","files":null}]}
