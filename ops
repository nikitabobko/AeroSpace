For example, if I have 2 windows in h_tiles and I add a third one, I want it to be positioned in the bottom right corner of my screen like this:\n\nh_tiles\n├── window 1\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2\n    └── window 3\nAnd when a fourth window is opened, it should resize into this layout:\n\nh_tiles\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 1\n    └── window 4\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2\n    └── window 3\nI tried to achieve this using a bash script triggered by the command:\n\n[[on-window-detected]]\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nrun = ['exec-and-forget ~/.scripts/layout.sh']\nBut I encountered this error:\n\non-window-detected[0]: For now, 'layout floating', 'layout tiling' and 'move-node-to-workspace' are the only commands that are supported in 'on-window-detected'. Please report your use cases to https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/20\nIf you need help with this issue or want to know how to work around it, let me know!","files":null}]}
