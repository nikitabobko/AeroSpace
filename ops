For instance, I would like to write a script to move a window to a specific `dfs-index`, but would need both the `dfs-index` (https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/667) of the currently focused window as well as its layout type. So, adding the layout type and `dfs-index` to the `list-windows` output would help, thanks!","files":null}]}
