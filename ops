To me, these feel more intuitive for solving the root usability issues.\n\ne.g., for @Marty-W's scenarios:\n\n\u003e 1 work: docs/terminal | code | localhost\n\u003e 2 leisure: (gap) | browser | (gap)\n\u003e 3 focused work: (gap) | browser | code | (gap)\n\nLet's say the monitor width is 3440px, the alignment is set to \"center\" and the max width is set to 1500.\n\nIn scenario 1, each windows takes ~1146px, which is less than the max width, so the look is the same as the vertical tiling today.\n\nIn scenario 2, the window would have taken the full 3440px, but is instead maxed out at 1500px. Additionally, the window would be aligned in the center.\n\nIn scenario 3, each window maxes out at 1500px and because thee two windows combined still don't reach the full monitor width, they are aligned in the center, leaving a 220px gap on each side (440px total).","files":null}]}
