Some letters work such as U and M but others such as ASDFXW don't. That means I can't use `alt-s` to open that workspace, nor `alt-shift-s` to move a node to that work space.\n\nHas someone ran into this before?\n\n**I'm not using a custom keyboard. On my Mac I have US Keyboard and input**\n\nI've seen this thread, but it doesn't seem like it's resolved. https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/93\n\nI've also tried remapping via `[key-mapping.key-notation-to-key-code]` the standard letters eg `a = 'a'`\n\nChecklist\n[x] I've searched for duplicates.
