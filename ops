However, the closed app remains running in the background. To fully quit the app, I need to use Cmd+Tab to bring it back into focus, then Cmd+Q to close it.\n\nHow do I change this behavior so when the last tab or window of an app is closed, the app will remain in focus, allowing me to immediately quit it using Cmd+Q? Only after quitting the app, aerospace would switch focus to another active app in the workspace.\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
