For now, I've swapped `alt` for `ctrl`. Maybe it's because alt + some alpha on mac actually map modifiers. For example, my `u` with `alt` maps to `umlaut` in German.\n\nMaybe we can adjust the documentation to warn user's that alt doesn't work with some alpha keys, or are other mac user's not having this issue?","files":null}]}
