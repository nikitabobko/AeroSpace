That's fine I suppose, but some modes can be sticky (more like VISUAL mode in vim is sticky).\n\nI don't know what you mean by `ctrl-a` for \"selection/manipulation\"?\n\nOnce Aerospace CLI performs better, I'll switch to using skhd for binding so that way I can run a command when entering a mode to make some visual change to my desktop so that way it's obvious when one is in a sticky mode and there would be less need to rely on motions.","files":null}]}
