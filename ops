They do work when i run the command in the terminal so its about detecting the keybind. Is there any debug mode that could \"listen\" to keybinds and just print in the terminal what is recognized from aerospace? This way i can more easily debug what's going on.\n\nAlso, is there any posible numerical indicator to what workspace are you on right now? Would be nice to have an icon on the topbar with it, didnt find anything on docs.\n\nTy","files":null}]}
