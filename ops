In macOS you can set up keyboard shortcuts to switching desktops.\n\nnot rly, it has animations and thats the reason we meet here in the first place. If there was bind to instantly switch to another macos WS then we would not need anything else.\n\nRecently i switched to raycast with binds for specific programs and its honestly what i wanted always. If you rarely have more than one window per WS, raycast will be all you need ....and its instant (and even opens app if its not running ðŸ¤¤)","files":null}]}
