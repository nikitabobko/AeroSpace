This issue is currently being worked on in #445, so it may work better with the Contexts app in the future.\n\nThanks! Funny you mention that, I also use Raycast and found the **Switch Windows** command. I migrated over from Contexts, and it works just about as well for application switching. Happy to remove one piece of redundant software from my stack; and it also works much better with AeroSpace.\n\nI combined the above with [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) for thumbnails and am happy with the result!","files":null}]}
