I guess this could already be done using two separate commands to set `width` and `height` individually but a single command might be nicer.\n\nRationale: When using very large screens (eg. 42\" OLED), I find it useful to be able to float a window and set it to a \"reasonable\" size that I pre-define. Often I will also centre this window and black out the surrounds using https://github.com/dwarvesf/blurred in order to be able to focus on that. Depending on the window contents, it's nice to be able to tweak the size easily.\n\nAnyway, just some extra thoughts! Thank you @nikitabobko for all your work on this project! ðŸ˜Ž","files":null}]}
