So most of the time, I have a setup where I am using 3 verticals terminals windows with Rectangle, with around 10 tabs.\nAlso, this issue seems to happen with others app too, like Fork. \nSo yeah, just to say that, as a user, may be hard to workaround over all the specific edges cases that trigger this behavior.","files":null}]}
