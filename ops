It adds this persistent pill UI to the bottom of the main display that toggles on/off to display when Flow is capturing audio (see image below of pill in the \"off\" state).\n\n![CleanShot 2024-11-26 at 20 45 06@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9150e10-6f61-40c0-8fb6-5f170cca635d)\n\nWhen launching Aerospace, the layouts did not work as expected. I tracked it down to the fact that it treats Flow as an open window, but there is no actual window to move. I tried moving Flow to its own workspace but that caused the floating pill to blink and move wildly. Quitting the Flow app entirely and restarting Aerospace fixed the issue and I was able to operate it normally.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\n- https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/471\n- https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/552 - This was the first thing I tried to look for to just have AeroSpace ignore this app\n\n**Notes**\n- using the default config\n- AeroSpace v0.15.2-Beta\n- macOS Sequoia 15.1.1\n- the `debug-windows` command does not print any output from the Flow \"window\"\n\n\n![CleanShot 2024-11-26 at 21 10 57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c6faaa6-0361-4a51-9281-6f28f248595b)","files":null}]}
