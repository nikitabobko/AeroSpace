As the documentation [points out](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement), this method imposes limitations on monitor configurations. Many popular setups, such as [triple-screen](https://www.google.com/search?q=triple-monitor-setup) and [tie-fighter](https://www.google.com/search?q=tie-fighter-monitor-setup) arrangements, are incompatible with Aerospace.\n\nIt's possible to create virtual displays that exist only in memory. In fact, the popular application [BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) recently added a feature to manage virtual displays.\n\nI propose an Aerospace feature that would allow users to specify a virtual display to use as a \"free space\" for hiding windows. This would accommodate any monitor configuration the user desires. To keep Aerospace as lightweight as possible, this could be implemented as BYOVD (bring-your-own-virtual-display)â€”users could then use whichever virtual display management app they prefer and simply tell Aerospace which display to use for hiding.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [X] I've searched for duplicates.
