It is a nice fresh breath of air coming from yabai + skhd, have been loving it so far.\n\nCurrently the config file `.aerospace.toml` needs to be stored in the home folder. While it is not particularly irksome, it does add to the large list of dotfiles in the home folder to make things a little bit more cluttered.\n\nI'm wondering would it be possible that Aerospace would support alternative config location such as `.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`? Thank you.","files":null}]}
