I think I've figured out what the issue is in the way AeroSpace handles its virtual spaces. It's a combination of 2 different issues:\n- When focusing a workspace, it appears that the window first gets maximized off-screen and then moved into focus.\n- Windows by default will go to the bottom right when you focus away from their workspace.\n\nBelow, I've also shown my display configuration from settings, and I think the problem is because the display on the right is smaller than the primary display on the left, when I focus a workspace, it'll maximize the window to the size of the smaller display, move it to the bigger display, and then resize it again to fit the bigger display.\n\n**macOS Version:** 14.3\n**Keyboard Layout:** QWERTY\n**Config:** https://github.com/tale/dotfiles/blob/main/config/bash/aerospace.toml\n**Aerospace Version:**\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.8.3-Beta bf02074c6aad434701809471fffdc7756e69d17e\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.8.3-Beta bf02074c6aad434701809471fffdc7756e69d17e\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/46133336/0b894a2e-81f8-48f1-8922-f4f9261274e5\n\n![CleanShot 2024-02-04 at 14 50 30](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/46133336/4718fbdb-48ff-4dcd-a215-38ce94d9dbb6)","files":null}]}
