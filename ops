I use one workspace (workspace 2) for my communication apps (Slack, Discord, Mumble, Telegram, ...)\n2. They are in a stacked layout\n\nSo, when I use alt-2, I switch to that workspace, which is great. But if the wrong app is in foreground, I have to reach over to alt-k to switch containers. \n\nSure, I could remap this binding to e.g. alt-e (that's unusued in my config), but I would love if I could just keep hitting alt-2. \n\nYou can approximate it with \n\n```\nalt-2 = ['workspace 2', 'focus down']\n```\n\nbut that means that whever I go back to workspace 2, I get a new random app. \n\nThe best alternative I've found is to swap those commands:\n\n```\nalt-2 = ['focus down', 'workspace 2']\n```\n\nBut that means if I have another layout stacked somewhere, it breaks that before leaving, which is annoying. \n\nEssentially, what I want is that `focus down` is only executed if the active workspace is already workspace 2.","files":null}]}
