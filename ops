There's no built-in command for this specific action in Aerospace but there is the \"resize\" command which I tried to use as a workaround by assigning `z = 'resize smart +10000'` in my config. \n\nThis *seemed* to be working until I moved focus to the \"hidden\" window, which results in Aerospace crashing. That is, if I use `resize smart +10000` on window 2 in the following layout and later try to focus on window 3, Aerospace stops.\n\n```\nh_tiles\n├── window 1\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2 (resized)\n    └── window 3 (implicitly hidden)\n```\n\nI believe this is because aerospace is trying to focus a window that's actually off-screen. I don't know if it qualifies as a bug since it is mentionned in the guide that MacOS doesn't support having windows off-screen but still, if anyone knows a way around this problem, let me know!","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1730825421,"nonce":"BbIoH0bsOySSLRw/wj5T49uiwpk=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6dHeG5zwAAAAOFcMKH"},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":2,"timestamp":1730825437,"nonce":"ScAC6acKk/kBoMjKPxVaKlcL9zA=","metadata":{"github-id":"RTE_lADOJl1IZM6dHeG5zwAAAAOFcNFX"},"title":"\"Hiding\" windows with resize will crash aerospace if you focus on the hidden window","was":"\"Hiding\" windows with resize will crash aerospace if you focus on the hidden window"}]}
