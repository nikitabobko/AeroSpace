As a side effect:\n1. It will make AeroSpace less aggressive on invisible workspaces windows position, and it will resolve this issue\n2. It will improve performance in general when a lot of windows are \"hidden\" in invisible workspaces\n\nI didn't forget about this issue, but no ETA.","files":null}]}
