But to give more context, the internal tools are typically non resizable and they are forced to be in the \"floating\" layout. All windows created by these tools also have the \"floating\" layout.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open an app that is floating\n2. Make another window using the app \n3.  Swap to a different workspace\n4. Swap back to the initial workspace\n\nExpected : Windows created by the app retain their positions before changing the workspace\nActual : Windows created by the app are hidden away in the lower left corner","files":null}]}
