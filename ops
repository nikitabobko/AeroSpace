It will help with apps that allow dragging their tabs out to create new windows. Right now, the experience is sluggish when you try to drag tab out of Google Chrome\n\nNoticeable apps: Google Chrome, Brave\n\nGoogle Chrome and Brave dragged tabs also don't have fullscreen button for the time of new window detection. In case of Brave, it leads to Brave dragged tabs/windows being detected as floating by default: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/340\n\nIn case of Chrome, there is a hack in AeroSpace the source code that tiles all Chrome windows regardless of the fullscreen button, which leads to other problems: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/246 https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/933\n\nThe approach with delaying new windows detection until the mouse is up will help to resolve all these problems","files":null},{"type":2,"timestamp":1737231420,"nonce":"aQgO348yHjJndFA7M6m3Dk1Mtsk=","metadata":{"github-id":"RTE_lADOJl1IZM6muU26zwAAAAO439lE"},"title":"Delay new window detection until mouse is up (e.g. Google Chrome tab drag)","was":"Delay new window detection until mouse is up (e.g. Google Chrome tab drag)"},{"type":3,"timestamp":1737234306,"nonce":"03ADH2GYSLqA4Q9bIaYkILj2S0s=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6a-C0b","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1001#issuecomment-2599955739"},"message":"And window destruction detection should be probably delayed for the same reasons","files":null}]}
