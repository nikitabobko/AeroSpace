Chrome in a workspace where there has not been one before. But if I then tell Spotlight to open Chrome the workspace gets switched to the one I last used Chrome in. Is there any possibility of opening the new Chrome window in the current workspace? \n\nThanks for this great piece of software btw!","files":null}]}
