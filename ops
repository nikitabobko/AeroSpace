So far, I can only reproduce this on [cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).\n\nI don't have `cmd + w` bound to anything on aerospace but `option + w` (`alt-w` on the config file) is set to `'close'`.\n\nI've attached a video to showcase it. The first instance of closing cyberduck is using `cmd + w` where it doesn't focus on the other window while the second instance is using the aerospace `close` shortcut.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/20115135/0274432c-99f4-4087-b6c2-6e31dc729c1d","files":null}]}
