E.g. I would be on workspace 2, do \"meta + 5\" and move to workspace 5. Hitting \"meta + 5\" again would bring me back to the last one (workspace 2), and so forth, resulting in the \"back and forth\" behaviour.\n\nIn Sway, I actually have both ðŸ˜Š.\n\nIs there a way in Aerospace to get the second behaviour? I haven't found it.","files":null}]}
