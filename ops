The feature has to come with some kind of visual indication\n2. It will complicate the focus handling logic for a very minor use case\n\nThe only mentioned use case in this thread is to grab a container and move it around. Well, I think `move --parent` will work just good enough for such cases https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1190 I think it should be enough to access only one parent up. If users want to access more than 1 parent up, ~~they are sick~~ it could be supported in the future like `--parent --parent` or `--parent 2` idk\n\nAnd with modes, it actually becomes possible to emulate `focus child|parent` i3 behavior:\n\n```toml\n[mode.main.binding]\n  alt-a = 'mode parent' # focus parent in i3\n\n[mode.parent.binding]\n  alt-shift-h = 'move --parent left'\n  alt-shift-j = 'move --parent down'\n  alt-shift-k = 'move --parent up'\n  alt-shift-l = 'move --parent right'\n```\n\n\u003e That being said, this feels like a rabbit hole, because the other thing that i3 has that aerospace does not to make that whole workflow much more doable was the stack/tab UI\n\nI hope to implement smth like `stackline` in the future https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/24#issuecomment-1872588387 (Or I will be happy if somebody contributes it)\n\n---\n\nI'm closing this issue in favor of https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1190","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1741649729,"nonce":"paRKJJ+mwPbFgoeRrPuaFzz/PXw=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM51OsJRzwAAAAPhMD5Y"},"status":2}]}
