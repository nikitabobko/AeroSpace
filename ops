When you have different windows of the same program open in multiple workspaces, and you move between them, exec-on-workspace-change isn't called.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1708130469,"nonce":"GqGNk6SVHZHpACx6zpJQoruLIr8=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM50M5j2","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/157#issuecomment-1949538550"},"message":"Disregard, I had a mistake in one of my configs.
