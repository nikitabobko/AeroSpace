The iOS Simulator _can't_ be resized to be bigger than its max size, so it behaves very strangely  with Aerospace, sometimes flickering on a 2nd display until I move something.\n\nWhen I use the keyboard shortcuts to resize the window to be smaller (to match its actual size) then everything else works great.\n\nAny workarounds until this is supported?","files":null}]}
