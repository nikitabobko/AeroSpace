I've configured MacOS to treat them as one by disabling spaces, which allows me to centre position windows. The reason being this makes it possible for an M1 Pro Macbook to display a 120Hz desktop at full 7680x2160 resolution - something that isn't possible with a single cable with the M1's.\n\nMy question is this - before I found Aerospace, I used Apple Scripts and a Stream Deck to provide me with some rudimentary 'tiling' features, like displaying a window 1/3 width in the centre of the virtual screen (so basically 1/6 on one screen and the other 1/6 on the other).\n\nIs it possible with AeroSpace to display a workspace than spans multiple screens? I don't necessarily need multiple workspaces - but that would be nice.\n\nApologies in advance if this isn't the right place to make queries - I didn't see an alternative channel.","files":null}]}
