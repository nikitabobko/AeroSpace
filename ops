The default value would be `2` and could be customized by the user. That would not break any existing user configs. The padding would also play along nicely.\n\nIn addition to that, I would like to suggest a better visualization. Currently, if you focus the lowest accordion item, it overlays the top one which again makes you lose context about what you have open below that. I have created a little visualization on how that could be improved. If the idea is too drastic, it could be locked behind a feature flag as well.\nHopefully it becomes clear with the following image:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/denisloch/f0270bb13a0a4c03680a1ec950f30d0e/raw/f7b6235d32eed6b07f7b536ce53721fc59b16642/file.svg\" /\u003e\n  \nPlease feel free to criticize and improve my idea.\nCheers :)","files":null}]}
