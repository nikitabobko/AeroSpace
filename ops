Unfortunately it just does it for one of my workspaces. \nI guess because those window is not really hidden or minimized, it just moves out of focus? I can move it via move-node.\n\nI could imagine:\n- 'move-node-to-frontmost-workspace' by detecting\n- a 'follow_workspace' variable \n- or assign to 'workspace 0' to match all workspaces by detecting (similar approach apple does by assigning an App to several Desktops)\n\n**I tried things like:**\n\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.window-title-regex-substring = 'SideNotes'\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nif.workspace = '1'\nrun = ['move-node-to-workspace 1']\nif.workspace = '2'\nrun = ['move-node-to-workspace 2']\nif.workspace = '3'\nrun = ['move-node-to-workspace 3']\nif.workspace = '4'\nrun = ['move-node-to-workspace 4']\n\nwhich are not working and may a bit hacky anyway. \n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
