For example I can put in smaller PRs and we could tackle this incrementally or I can put the PR in as a whole. I was thinking as a first pass we could simply address the bridging header.\n\nRegarding bundling; I completely agree with you. The final artifact should be an app bundle.\n\nI'm not sure if you saw my edited points in the post above - I think you replied as I was adding them. But I tested manually putting the bundle together and it worked well. So we could write a script to take the build output and construct the app bundle with it.\n\nThis also means we could keep BundleEx.swift if you wanted to. The bundle introspection in swift reads from the Info.plist inside the bundle which is just a glorified xml file.\nI'm not against hardcoding the appId and other metadata if you'd rather, though.\n\nAs an aside, I found [this tool](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler) months back and forgot it existed until just now. I'm not sure if it's worth relying on a third party build tool, but it's an app bundler for swift package manager.","files":null}]}
