I am using a 28-inch monitor. When only one application is open, the window stretches across the entire screen, making it too wide and challenging to navigate efficiently.\n\nIt might be helpful to have a feature that allows for managing the window size or position in such scenarios.\n\nThis is the result I am aiming for. The window could be also be on the left or right, not just center.\n![image](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/8164667/e25a6f64-ec7b-40af-b6e3-7a47237e779d)","files":null}]}
