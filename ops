My workflow for work is based on using Microsoft Remote Desktop, or now called \"Windows App\". I am using 3 Monitors and the RDP client will open 3 Monitors, but in macos workspaces.\n\n``` \n~ ‚ùØ aerospace list-windows --all\n4983 | Firefox                          | New Issue ¬∑ nikitabobko/AeroSpace\n3760 | Microsoft Teams (work or school) | Activity | Microsoft Teams\n6455 | WezTerm                          | zsh\n5044 | Windows App                      | 192.168.31.125\n4325 | Windows App                      | Devices\n```\n\nWindows App | Devices is the control center where i can connect to my windows machine\nWindows App | 192.xxxx is the connection itself. When focusing on that, all displays will appear.\nMy goal is to have 3 different windows which i can focus.\n\nThis issue cant be fixed by making aerospace changes, but maybe someone else has the same problem using different apps which creates native macos workspaces?\n\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
