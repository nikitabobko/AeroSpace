Caps Lock (literally F18, literally ⌘⇧⌥⌃) + HJKL --\u003e Focus\n2. ⌘+Caps Lock (literally F18, literally ⌘⇧⌥⌃) + HJKL --\u003e Expand\n3. ⇧+Caps Lock (literally F18, literally ⌘⇧⌥⌃) + HJKL --\u003e Move\n4. ...\n\nFor now I solved the problem by triggering AeroSpace via shell from Hammerspoon, where I bound the Keys properly. \n\nIntegration of F-keys would be anyway useful.\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
