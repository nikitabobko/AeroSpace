That issue has fully gone away, and the mild performance issues I'd been experiencing across Aerospace before also seem to have been resolved from it, which is awesome! However, after using Aerospace with this setting off for a bit, I've noticed a new issue which I don't think I ever experienced before turning it off. I am now often seeing windows in the accordion layout (my most common layout) getting slightly cut off at their bottom or right edge (depending on layout orientation).\n\nHere is a recording of me playing around with a workspace with just two windows, switching between vertical and horizontal orientation and switching between the two windows in each orientation: \n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fba2ab3-9c0e-442d-97f8-8b5f3920b223\n\nIn the recording, you can see that my workspace is laid out in horizontal accordion at first. The right edge of the rightmost window is cut off! When I switch to vertical accordion, the effect is harder to see (I'm actually not sure that it's consistently happening right now, but it definitely was a little earlier). You can also see that in horizontal accordion layout, the rightmost window for some reason has a vertical padding in addition to its expected horizontal one. Maybe related?\n\nHere is my monitor layout, if it helps: \n\u003cimg width=\"227\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c627eb-f1a3-4c42-8ff7-4527833a73ee\"\u003e\n\nI am seeing this behavior on my middle monitor, which is my primary monitor. I cannot reproduce this with multiple windows on my laptop monitor, which is the smaller one on the bottom right. But I can also reproduce it in the same way on my left monitor. It seems like it has something to do with aerospace detecting that there is more screenspace to the right, or something like that?","files":null}]}
