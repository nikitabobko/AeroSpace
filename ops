I think the main challenge is that it's often difficult for me to map what I see on the screen to what Aerospace's internal tree representation is, which I believe is a prerequisite to being able to manipulate the windows efficiently (please let me know if I'm mistaken!)\n\nIf Aerospace had a way to visually communicate the internal tree structure at any given time, then it might be easier for people to get the hang of things. I'm not sure how to do this in realtime without affecting the tree structure (kind of a SchrÃ¶dinger's cat situation ðŸ˜…). A half-step might be a command + hot key that takes a screen grab and overlays a representation of the tree structure so you can at least review after the fact.\n\nI know this is a little out there :) Feel free to close, and maybe I will take a crack at this when I find some time.","files":null}]}
