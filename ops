This makes using them on a screen like those described very difficult.\n\nIn my case, I've got a Pro Display XDR, and seeing windows like Finder, Notes, etc. full screen is jarring and offputting to the point where it's impractical to use them with AeroSpace. #552 would also help out in this instance.\n\nMax width would be a great solution, as in a space where only one window is present, but max width is enforced, the surrounding space would simply be the desktop.\n\nI'll also note that in some cases, perhaps restricted to certain spaces, max height would also be beneficial. That's because with a monitor as large as the Pro Display, keeping my vision centered in the middle is sometimes preferred, and a 100% height window can also be unwieldy.\n\nLove the project so far @nikitabobko and looking forward to being able to use AeroSpace one day!","files":null}]}
