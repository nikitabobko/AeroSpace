Each workspace container contains multiple workspaces that can be toggled between, while leaving the other containers / workspaces in view. Functionally, this is identical to if X, Y, and Z were on separate displays.\n```\n-----------------------------------------------\n|            .                  .             |\n|            .                  .             |\n|      X     .

There are a few monitors that have [picture-by-picture](https://www.samsung.com/hk_en/support/computing/what-is-the-difference-between-pip-and-pbp/) functionality which partitions the display into multiple smaller displays, but this feature is rare, limited by hardware decisions made by the manufacturer, and requires multiple HDMI connections.\n\nI'm not under any impression that this would be easy (or even possible?) to implement. But I figure I'd throw it out there as an idea, because it's kind of my dream window management feature. ðŸ˜» \n\n## Checklist\n\n- [X] I've searched for duplicates.
