I think defining the boundary of what AeroSpace is and isn't and then aggressively closing Issues/PRs for things outside of the boundary will keep the project focused and hopefully reduce outside noise. Maybe as a bonus, add a basic suggestion (with a disclaimer that it's not a recommendation) to the Guide for projects people could look at if they want UI stuff.\n\nAka, I vote you close this issue rather than leaving the door open.","files":null}]}
