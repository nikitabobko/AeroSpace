How to toggle on/off the gaps?\nFor example, if I press `Alt + G` and the gaps are set to 10, it toggles them off (set gaps to `0`), and if I press `Alt + G` again, it sets them back to `10`.\n2. How to set a window size to a third of the screen/monitor size? Is it possible?\n\n\nThanks in advance for all the help!","files":null}]}
