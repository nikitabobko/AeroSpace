I upgraded to macOS 15.1 beta 3 and reinstalled AeroSpace, but the issue continued. I then quit all running apps and background processes, and I found that the [Contexts app](https://contexts.co/) was causing the problem. If anyone else has this issue, quit Contexts and restart AeroSpace to fix it.","files":null}]}
