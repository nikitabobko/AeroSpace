No shortcut to these workspaces exist\n\n**How to reproduce**\n\nStarting point:\n1. monitor1: workspace 10\n3. monitor2: workspace 8\n4. laptop lid: closed\n5. no other workspaces exists\n6. Configuration parts:\n```\n...\n[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]\n8 = 'Monitor2'\n\n[mode.main.binding]\nalt-0 = 'workspace 10'\nalt-1 = 'workspace 1'\nalt-2 = 'workspace 2'\nalt-3 = 'workspace 3'\nalt-4 = 'workspace 4'\nalt-5 = 'workspace 5'\nalt-6 = 'workspace 6'\nalt-7 = 'workspace 7'\nalt-8 = 'workspace 8'\nalt-9 = 'workspace 9'\n```\n\n7. Open the Macbook lid\n\nResults in:\nmonitor1: workspace 11 (not reachable via shortcut)\nmonitor2: workspace 8\nlaptop screen: workspace 10 (moved from monitor1)\n\nIssues:\n1. workspace 10 should have stayed on monitor1 and not moved\n2. workspace 11 can't be reached via keybinding, the other workspaces (1-7 and 9) are unassigned.\n\nSame setting \u0026 steps above:\n8. I close the laptop lid\n\nResult:\n1. monitor1: keeps workspace 11\n2. monitor2: workspace 8 \u0026 10. workspace 10 is the active workspace. Before workspace 8 was active and should have stayed active\n\nContinuing with above flow:\n9. opening macbook display\n\nResult:\n1. monitor1: gets workspace 10 (that was previously on monitor2)\n2. monitor2: gets workspace 8 (that is pinned to this monitor)\n3. laptop display: gets workspace 11 (that was on monitor1 before)\n\n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\nN/A","files":null}]}
