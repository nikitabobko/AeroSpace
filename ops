Attempt to navigate back and forth with 'focus-left and 'focus-right' keybinds. User's focus will consistently be redirected to Primary/Workspace 0 unintentionally.\n\nIt's not 100% consistent, sometimes you can 'focus-right' or 'focus-left' a few times but almost always within the first few times you'll get sent back to the primary monitor.\n\nLove the app! Finally have a way to make navigating MacOS intuitive. I'm just disappointed it took me so long to take the plunge.\n\n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.15.2-Beta b6cf82771f245ab7349a93baf8709e171537ff58\n```","files":null}]}
