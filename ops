This requires a convenient indication of this mode to remind me to exit back to the main mode - the built-in AeroSpace widget for the macOS menu bar handles this perfectly. However, my issue is that I use sketchybar, and the built-in menu bar automatically hides.\n\nI've already implemented workspace display and switching for sketchybar using on-focus-changed / exec-on-workspace-change. However, when searching for similar callbacks about switching the binding mode, I couldn't find one.\n\nCould you please advise if I might have missed this in the documentation? If so, I'd appreciate a link to the relevant section.\n\nIf such functionality is not currently implemented, I'd like to suggest expanding the list of callbacks to include a new one that would be triggered when the binding mode changes.","files":null}]}
