The menu bar is programmed in Swift UI and [I tried](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/main/src/AeroSpaceApp.swift#L78) to make it monospaced but it didn't work.\n\nI suspect that macOS simply doesn't allow changing the font of the tray items. Are there any known apps that show their tray item in monospaced? macOS clock doesn't count. It's a system thing, it can have more privileges","files":null}]}
