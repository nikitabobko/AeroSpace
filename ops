Thanks for the report!\n\n\u003e When focusing a workspace, it appears that the window first gets maximized off-screen and then moved into focus.\n\nUnfortunately, this is needed, otherwise, in some cases, macOS goes crazy and doesn't set sizes that I said it to set #143 \n\n\u003e Windows by default will go to the bottom right when you focus away from their workspace.\n\nAeroSpace could be more intelligent here and try to find spots where it could hide windows on the current monitor.
