Will try this out for a bit, I have no idea if it's related at all.\n\n\u003e Also: have you disabled window decorations for some of the apps? I think it might be related as well\n\nYes, I have an Emacs instance running without window decorations. I'll try to use with decorations on report if there is an improvement.","files":null}]}
