This is something I first saw while using `yabai` a couple of years ago and I also saw it while using `amethyst`.\n\nMy use case is quite simple, I mainly do web development using a 32\" monitor and, while making prototypes or doing manual testing, I need to use the mouse to test the interactions. It would be nice if the mouse is already in the center of the window so I don't need to move it from left/right.","files":null}]}
