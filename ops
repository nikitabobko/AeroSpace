However, after every upgrade, MacOS fails to run the binary, marking it as spam even though the installation was done via `--no-quarantine` flag. I manually kill the old process ID via `ps aux | grep aerospace` and `kill -9 $PROCESS_ID`, but when I try to restart aerospace again, nothing happens.\n\nEventually, I have to restart my mac to make everything work again.","files":null}]}
