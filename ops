But with my config, where workspaces are pinned to monitors and windows are pinned to workspaces in config, it doesn't matter much. I lose ordering of terminal windows after a break, but that I can live with, compared to the app being unusable for me. So the changes I had are just trading one problem for another, it's not a fix of any kind. I'll sit \u0026 wait for a proper solution :D","files":null}]}
