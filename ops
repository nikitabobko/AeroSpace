The terminal app ignores aerospaces shortcut and simply inputs 'ยก'. This is fine on its own, as you can simply exit out of terminal with the Aerospace menu icon (by moving to another workspace), and Aerospace continues to work fine if you do that. \n\nHowever, if you stop the terminal, it breaks the aerospace keybindings in all windows/workspaces. After closing the terminal app, alt+{key} simply enters the alternative version of that key or does the associated default macOS shortcut based on the key combo. The only way I have found to rectify this state is to first disable aerosapce, then reset my keyboard in System Setting -\u003e Keyboard -\u003e Input Sources -\u003e Edit and changing to another keyboard then back to the default then re-enabling aerospace. This happens with my config and the default config, but doesn't happen with terminal emulators (Iterm is fine).\n\noutput of aerospace --version: \n```\naerospace CLI client version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\nAeroSpace.app server version: 0.14.2-Beta 0cb8dbdfc5ee73b8cbc200f175f467ebead55201\n```","files":null}]}
