I can use `resize`, but then i need to `resize` it back. Also, sometimes I forget how many times I resized and it takes effort to return it to perfect size.\n\n**Alternative approaches:**\n\n1. Use `resize` ( what I do now ): `alt-z = 'resize smart +400'` and `alt-x = 'resize smart -400'`\n- Downsides:\n  - need two hotkeys\n  - user can zoom in more than once by accident\n\n2. Possibly use `fullscreen`, but add a number argument ( and if provided, also accept a smart|width|height ), if provided - use it, if not - go fullscreen.\n\n**Synopsis**\n```\nUSAGE: zoom [-h|--help] (smart|width|height) \u003cnumber\u003e\n\nOPTIONS:\n  -h, --help             Print help\n\nARGUMENTS:\n  (smart|width|height)   Dimension to resize\n  \u003cnumber\u003e               Number\n```\n\nI am not a swift guy at all, but I am willing to work on this feature if it will be useful, Let me know!","files":null}]}
