Aerospace is great so far. I'm trying to replace my yabai with aerospace and here's my question:\n\n1. As title says, exec-and-forget to open an app not working.\n2. How can I check logs if something's wrong?\n3. What's the right way to escape a quotation marks and do I need to?\n\nHere's my config\n\n```toml\n# This works\nalt-enter = 'exec-and-forget open -n /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app'\n\n# Not working\ncmd-ctrl-h = 'exec-and-forget open -a Lark'\ncmd-ctrl-j = 'exec-and-forget open -a iTerm'\ncmd-ctrl-k = 'exec-and-forget open -a \\\"Microsoft Edge\\\"'\ncmd-ctrl-l = 'exec-and-forget open -a Goland'\n```\n\nHere's my debug steps:\n\n1. `alt-enter` works so the grammar is ok.\n2. I execute `bash -c \"open -a Lark\"` directly on shell. It works. So the command is ok.\n3. I also tried: replace `Lark` with full path.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!","files":null}]}
