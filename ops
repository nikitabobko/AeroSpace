Sequoia has implemented several changes to this API, which has caused problems for window managers like [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/issues/1662). Unfortunately, I am not familiar enough with this API to identify the exact issue. It might be possible to reproduce the problem using a demo app in Xcode by comparing the list of windows reported by the accessibility API before and after closing a window. This could then be reported to the developers of the affected apps. The Contexts app hasn't been updated for several years, so I have now switched to an alternative.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1727363189,"nonce":"PifhuJM/rqZnlh2liuVI5/74VEw=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6NsdNK","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/471#issuecomment-2377241418"},"message":"The yabai window manager experienced the same issue when using Contexts or Amazon Q ([Issue 2324](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/2324#issuecomment-2376590474), [Issue 2431](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/2431#issuecomment-2376560387)).
