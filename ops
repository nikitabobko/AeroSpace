You will still be able to see a few pixels of \"hidden\" windows in the bottom right corner of your screen. That means, that if AeroSpace crashes badly you will still be able to manually \"unhide\" the windows by dragging these few pixels to the center of the screen.\n\nFor me that is not a big deal but this gets especially noticeable when enabling gap, e.g.:\n\n```\ngaps.inner.horizontal = 12\ngaps.inner.vertical = 12\ngaps.outer.left = 12\ngaps.outer.bottom = 12\ngaps.outer.top = 24\ngaps.outer.right = 12\n```\n\nIt was indeed only after I did so that I realized the \"hidden\" windows in the bottom right corner of my screen. This is mostly cosmetics I know but raising the issue anyway just in case there is some hope / unexplored alternative that can do the trick in a better way.","files":null}]}
