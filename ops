After some research that included looking at some Alacritty github issues it appears that MacOS has spotty and undocumented behavior around when the `SHELL` environment variable is set or not. It sounds like a typical case of Apple just saying \"well the terminal app we ship you knows how to respect your chosen shell so that's good enough\". But then a lot of these cross platform terminals rely on the SHELL var being set correctly as that is how things are done on linux.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1715017505,"nonce":"GatqisRPeZF0j6VIdujzx+DwXjI=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6FRwZWzwAAAAL2EcsQ"},"status":2}]}
