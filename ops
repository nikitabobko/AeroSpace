What is your use case?\n\nThe use case is to fast switch maximised apps in the same workspace. E.g I like to have a workspace for IDEs where I have multiple instances (different folders/projects opened) and I like a stacked/accordion layout for that. \n\n\u003e I'm curious if it were possible to run layout command in on-window-detected callback, would it resolve your issue?\n\nYes sort of, but when using different apps I would need a rule for each of them to set the layout. It feels more natural to set the layout at the workspace configuration level. \n\nRegarding the syntax, I like your options (a) and (b).\nAnother approach would be to set the layout also in callback style `on-workspace-changed` (https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/87):\n\n```\n[[on-workspace-changed]]\nif.workspace-id = '1'\nif.during-aerospace-startup = true  # only run this once\nrun = ['layout h_accordion']\n```","files":null}]}
