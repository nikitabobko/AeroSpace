I wanted to suggest an enhancement regarding the tiles layout. In the current configuration, all windows are split equally to a ratio of 0.5. I am wondering if it's possible to introduce a setting that allows users to specify their desired split ratio.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer a golden ratio of 0.618. This is slightly larger than 0.5 and would help to ensure that my eyes are not constantly drawn to the split in the middle of the windows. At present, to avoid this distraction, I need to sit on one side of the table or constantly adjust my focus towards one side of the monitor.\n\nThis adjustment could work similarly to the split ratio settings in yabai, which you can read more about here: [yabai split ratios](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Configuration#split-ratios).\n\nThank you!","files":null}]}
