This app is amazing! I'd like to ask for insight on this bug \n\n[CleanShot 2024-05-08 at 21 34 08@2x (click me)](https://share.cleanshot.com/jLPrPX8G)\n\nI experience an issue on CleanShot X where their UI for selecting a monitor is captured and grabbed by AeroSpace and moved to the current focused monitor. \nHere's what I think is happening:\nThe supplementary \"Drag to select capture area.\" button is placed on my secondary display. CleanShot X can notify me that I can optionally use my secondary display. Aerospace recognizes this and moves the button to my primary display, as I just saw it open.\n\nI initially thought this config â†“ would help me, but it does not seem to work for that floating window from the CleanShot UI. \n```toml\n[[on-window-detected]]\nif.app-id = 'pl.maketheweb.cleanshotx'\ncheck-further-callbacks = true\nrun = 'layout floating'\n```\n\nDo you know how to better select this?","files":null}]}
