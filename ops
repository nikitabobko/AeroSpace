(It's basically the same thing)\n\n1. I created a new directory in `Sources` called `PrivateAPIBridge`, and in there a directory called `include`.  This directory contains two files:\n      - the `Bridged-Header.h` but renamed to `header.h` for easiness.\n      - a filed called `module.modulemap` which tells SPM how to present this header to swift:\n        ```\n        module PrivateAPIBridge {\n          header \"header.h\"\n          export *\n        }\n        ```\n2. I created a new build target in `Package.swift` and added it as a dependency of `AppBundle`:\n    ```\n        .target(\n            name: \"PrivateAPIBridge\",\n            path: \"Sources/PrivateAPIBridge\",\n            publicHeadersPath: \"include\"\n        ),\n    ```\n3. Now, anywhere in the `AppBundle` package, if we `import PrivateAPIBridge` we have access to `_AXUIElementGetWindow`. You can see in my branch, I did the bare minimum to use this, by simply immediately instanciating `BridgedHeaderImpl` in the `AppBundle` package instead of the launcher app.\n\n4. After this, It's simple enough to create another executable target in `Package.swift` using the code from the xcode-app-bundle-launcher to create an executable that will launch the app. Meaning it can be built and ran with `swift build`.\n\n## Caveats\nThere are a few things left to work out:\n- As SPM doesn't create an app bundle, but rather just the executable, bundling would need to be done via different means. \n    - I've not tested this yet, but seeing as mac app bundles are just a special directory structure with an info.plist, resources \u0026 and executable, I think we can achieve this fairly easily.\n- This also means bundle introspection won't work without extra steps. I had to implement some small hacks to load a default config and prevent the calls to `infoDictionary` from crashing due to the missing bundle info\n    - I *think* once the app is bundled and the info.plist is present this should work again\n\n## Benefits\nIf the last few caveats could be solved, I think this would make development much simpler. There is no need for lots of pre-build scripts and it entirely removes the dependency on xcode. And `swift build` is *fast*.\n\nI personally like to use neovim with sourcekit-lsp for swift development, so I am biased. Sourcekit-lsp isn't aware of any xcode project files/source locations so being able to rely only on SPM would be a huge boon.\n\nSorry for the rambling. I've not long finished work and am a bit fried.
