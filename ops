The [default bindings](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/config-examples.html#default-config) bind `alt-[a-z]` and I'd like those to become unbound so that they're passed through to the actual software I'm using.\n\nSo, I created an .aerospace.toml file that redefines all of `[mode.main.binding]` without these bindings.  I reloaded the config, and this resulted in the A-Z workspaces disappearing from the dropdown list, but hitting e.g. `alt-b` in fact still switched to workspace B, which then appeared in the list.  Switching back to workspace 0 made it disappear from the list.\n\nRestarting aerospace entirely got the desired effect, where aerospace is not intercepting `alt-[a-z]`.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1702708515,"nonce":"NP6bU6vBaPZmF26HfkagAdzAzKM=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5uyhwt","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/58#issuecomment-1858739245"},"message":"I couldn't find anything in the documentation that states how to undo default bindings in general - I was not sure that my `[mode.main.binding]`s would not be merged with the default ones.
