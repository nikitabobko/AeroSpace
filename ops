I could live with that, if they would not then overlap with the other tiles, so that I always have to fix the window size in the beginning. (I am on a MBP 14\")\n\n**Feature request:** \nDetect/Recognize that sort of windows and always rearrange all tiles such that every node is just tiled properly and does not overlap the other ones. That may negatively affect the size of the other tiled apps, but at least no information is get \"lost\" behind another window. \n\u003cimg width=\"1494\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2024-08-29 um 09 55 52\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38c607d5-6cbb-4a51-980e-4b3e66fceb0e\"\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
