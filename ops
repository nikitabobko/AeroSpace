If there are no more windows, Aerospace loses focus of any window.\n\n**I'd expect the focus to stay on the moved window (maybe this is related to #186).**\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. If more than one window on the focused workspace\n```shell\n➜ aerospace list-windows --workspace focused\n10885 | WezTerm  | aerospace\n10994 | TextEdit | Untitled\n~\n# with WezTerm as focused window\n➜ aerospace move-node-to-monitor next --wrap-around; \\\n  aerospace list-windows --focused\n10994 | TextEdit | Untitled\n```\n\n2. If only one window on the focused workspace\n```shell\n~\n➜ aerospace list-windows --workspace focused\n10885 | WezTerm | aerospace\n~\n➜ aerospace move-node-to-monitor next --wrap-around; \\\n  aerospace list-windows --focused\nNo window is focused\n```\n\nIf this is not really what's expected, I'd expect at least to be able to use the `focus` command on a specific window id, so that I could do\n\n1. Get focused windowID\n2. move-node-to-monitor\n3. focus $windowID\n\n---\nHacky workaround currently, maybe someone finds this useful. I usually only use (at most) 2 monitors, so I'm doing this:\n```shell\naerospace move-node-to-monitor next --wrap-around \u0026\u0026 aerospace focus-monitor next --wrap-around \u0026\u0026 aerospace list-windows --focused \n```","files":null}]}
