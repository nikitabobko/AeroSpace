So most of the time, I have a setup where I am using 3 verticals terminals windows with Rectangle, with around 10 tabs. Also, this issue seems to happen with others app too, like Fork. So yeah, just to say that, as a user, may be hard to workaround over all the specific edges cases that trigger this behavior.\n\nI know this is not a generic answer for all those cases, but at least for terminal, you could consider using something like tmux, where the concept of \"terminal tabs\" would translate to \"tmux windows\"","files":null}]}
