Any Idea of a possible workaround someone can think of? \n\nEdit: \nhaving a look at `aerospace list-windows --workspace D` the auto-complete tooltip/popup shows as App name = DBeaver and Window title = _empty_\n![image](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/24993816/5482dc1c-8d63-44f3-b59f-81b6f95f886c)\n\n---\n\nTested on:\nMacOS 14.2.1\nAeroSpace 0.7.1-Beta\nDBeaver 23.3.2","files":null}]}
