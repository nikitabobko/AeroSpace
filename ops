If so, this is exactly the kind of behavior that needs documentation.\n\nThat is precisely the case, but its not documented like you said.\nOn this note, I would even prefer to see an option to show the full mode name instead of just the first letter or even more customisation regarding the menubar and remove the need of sketchybar to show information about opened workspaces for example.","files":null}]}
