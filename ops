This would help me personally as I've bounced off of most tiling WMs I've tried due to the aggressive window management, and I can stick apps that are less flexible about window sizing in their own floating space.\n\nedit: one example is Messenger and Discord apps, neither of which can get narrow enough to correctly tile on the 1440x932 resolution of a 15\" Air, I'd rather just shove those in a floating space off somewhere.","files":null}]}
