However 'U' is the default workspace even though 'Y' is assigned first. \n``` yaml\n[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]\nY = 'secondary'\n# This line makes U the default workspace on the second monitor even though Y comes first in the config.\n# This most likely due the config being read in alphabetical order.\nU = 'secondary'\n```\nThere is no way to assign multiple workspaces to a secondary monitor AND choose a default workspace for said secondary monitor. The suspected issue is that forced assignment [happens alphabetically](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/blob/8d3e9f695f2c77eeb66424788bc0cf7d560dfb96/Sources/AppBundle/tree/WorkspaceEx.swift#L36), and not in order of config.  \n\nIs there any known way around this? I would be willing to work on a PR for this change.\n\nThis is an amazing project. Thank you all for an amazing tilling experience.","files":null}]}
