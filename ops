The other is a Nuphy Air 75 bluetooth keyboard and it requires the OS to be set to Colemak to work. In my .toml file, I have tried commenting out the default qwerty layout and leaving it in and in both cases tried adding the Colemak key mappings and commenting them out, each time reloading the config.\n\nThe behavior I'm seeing is that a lot of keys simply don't work. I wanted to map my mail app to Alt-Shift-m, but it acts like it doesn't even see it. I tried putting a window in the O workspace and it puts it in the Y workspace. For some reason the key mapping isn't working. I also can't place apps in many of the numbered workspaces while others seem to work fine. \n\nI REALLY like the idea of this app. If there is anything that can be done I am happy to do it. I've attached my aerospace.toml file (renamed to .txt, as you can see). \n[aerospace.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16603274/aerospace.txt)\n\nThanks.","files":null}]}
