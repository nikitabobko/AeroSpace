The issue might stem from the \"text cursor\" being treated as another current application window. I manually configured Aerospace to tile the application, which inadvertently may have included the \"text cursor\".\n\nA straightforward way to replicate this issue is observed when using \n\n`run = [\"layout tiling\", \"move-node-to-workspace term\"]`\n\nIn this scenario, the \"text cursor\" is treated as one of the tiled windows. However, when using only \n\n`run = [\"move-node-to-workspace term\"]`\n\nthe app wezterm gets tiled while the \"text cursor\" remains floating.\n\nThe reason I added layout tiling is because I treat all windows as floating by default, and only certain applications are managed under this setting.\n\n\n```toml\n# others ...\n\n#  all floating\n[[on-window-detected]]\n  if.app-name-regex-substring = \".*\"\n  check-further-callbacks = true\n  run = \"layout floating\"\n\n# others ...\n\n## emacs window\n[[on-window-detected]]\n  if.app-id = \"org.gnu.Emacs\"\n  run = [\"layout tiling\", \"move-node-to-workspace emacs\"]\n\n## terminal window\n[[on-window-detected]]\n  if.app-id = \"com.github.wez.wezterm\"\n  run = [\"layout tiling\", \"move-node-to-workspace term\"]\n\n# others ...\n```","files":null}]}
