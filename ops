I _usually_ like this one on Monitor D but sometimes I want to focus it by moving it to Monitor A. To have this flexibility I can't use `workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment` but then I have to manually move all my workspaces into position on every start, which is annoying.\n\nI'd like a `workspace-to-monitor-assignment` (no `force`) that assigns a workspace to a monitor, if it exists, at launch but doesn't force it to stay there. A \"reset this workspace to assigned monitor\" would be nice to avoid the workspace shuffle of moving one monitor-at-a-time.","files":null}]}
