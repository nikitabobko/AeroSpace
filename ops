Ideally, switching to an empty workspace should activate Finder (like the default Mission Control behaviour)\n\nFor example lets say you have 2 workspaces:\n\n- workspace 1 (empty)\n- workspace 2 (Safari)\n\nSwitching to `workspace 2` from `workspace 1` activates Safari as expected. But if you switch from `workspace 2` to `workspace 1`, Safari stays active (the menubar doesn't change to Finder), and any keyboard presses will still be sent to Safari.","files":null}]}
