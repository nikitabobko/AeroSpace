Containers that are placed inside accordion layout don't look nice https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/899\n2. It cannot \"raise windows\" without focusing them https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/567\n3. It's unclear how many windows are there in the accordion\n\nA separate layout `stack` which is rendered with indicators (e.g. like in `stackline` https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/24#issuecomment-1872588387) would be useful and would resolve those problems","files":null}]}
