So when I'm just browsing the web I don't really need all that screen real estate and having one window span the entire screen makes it harder to navigate (as @juniusfree  pointed out). The idea behind workspace three is that sometimes having too many windows open makes it harder for me to focus, so having just two, or only an editor makes it easier.","files":null}]}
