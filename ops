I feel like I looked through the list of issues to see if there were others, but completely missed this one.\n\nThe After Startup Command unfortunately is not enough for my use case, but combined with an 'on-monitor-configuration-changed' it would almost be. The one thing I would still be missing is an \"reset-to-default-monitor\" command.\n\nWhat I do worry about, though, is that the configuration would get quite bloated if you set default monitor assignment for your workspaces in multiple (up to 3) places. A 'workspace-to-monitor-default-assignment' setting would solve that for me.\nWhile I get your point about forced assignment, the workings of monitor assignment really confused me at first, and seeing as there are multiple issues about this subject probably other people as well.\n\nOverall, great product, this point is currently my one gripe with the issue.","files":null}]}
