Fork the repo, create a branch, update the docs (e.g. at docs/guide.adoc in the repo) then issue a pull request.\n\nThe dev has clearly put a lot of time into this project and released it for us to use at no cost. From doing some dev work myself I know that writing docs is the least fun and motivating part of the work. The docs are good but are not perfect, as you've pointed out. If you have the time but not the dev skills to fix bugs or make other enhancements then it would be great if you could contribute to the project by adding whatever you see as missing in the docs :-)","files":null}]}
