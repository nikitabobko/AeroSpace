I uninstalled it and the issue was solved. But I wish to keep using Amazon Q!\nI really wish this issue is fixed.\nFor now I am using @haveanicedavid workaround of adding alt-x='close' in my aerospace.toml but this way also it glitches sometimes.\nI have also created a automator shell script :\n`pkill -f AeroSpace\nopen -a \"AeroSpace\"`\nand then assigned a keyboard shortcut for this script to run. Whenever I face this issue (which is like very often), I use the keyboard shortcut to restart aerospace and it starts working again.\nBut, it's my request to developers to please fix this issue! I will be really grateful.. thank you.","files":null}]}
