I could live with that, if they would not then overlap with the other tiles. (I am on a MBP 14\")\n\n**Feature request:** \nDetect/Recognize that sort of windows and rearrange the other tiles in such that every app ist just tiled properly and does not overlap the other ones. That may negatively affect the size of the other tiled apps, but at least no information is get \"lost\" behind another window. \n\u003cimg width=\"1494\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2024-08-29 um 09 55 52\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38c607d5-6cbb-4a51-980e-4b3e66fceb0e\"\u003e\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
