I guess I'll just keep the setting off in that case. I have no need for fullscreen applications, especially when using all 3 monitors at once.\n\n\u003e You might also be running into this problem #149 (especially with 3 monitors)\n\nMaybe, but it seems like the symptom was different. I wasn't seeing windows flash resizing, I was just seeing a slight delay between inputting the command for focusing the next window and the next window actually being focused. But after turning off displays have separate spaces, I no longer notice a delay. Aerospace is snappier across the board, and I don't have the weird setup jitter anymore! :)","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1721252600,"nonce":"Y96k6AxBNLyXbfMbNLua7kS5uqU=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6P5zGmzwAAAAMnRGRM"},"status":2}]}
