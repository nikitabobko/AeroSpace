Looks promising. I'm a current user of Yabai and a couple of key features for me are:\n\n1. Ability to use a CLI to switch focus to a specific space/app -- if I'm in my terminal in space 10 on monitor 2, with a shortcut defined in Alfred I want to be able to switch to, say, Slack on space 3 on monitor 1. I currently do that by using a mix of `yabai -m window \u003cwindow id\u003e --focus` and I programatically get the `\u003cwindow id\u003e` by using `yabai -m query --windows`, which gives me a JSON blob of all open apps across all spaces, and I can then search for the right app and fetch the `window ID`.\n\n2. Assign apps to spaces -- if I open up Chrome, Slack, VS Code, Kitty, etc... Yabai is configured with \"rules\" so that it matches apps using regexs and puts them in the right spaces.\n\n3. Ability to turn off window borders and reduce window border width. Nice to have though and can live without.\n\nAny plans to support the above?\n\nI like Yabai except that it seems to break \u0026 require some work every time a new version of OS/X comes out plus it requires SIP to be disabled for manipulation of spaces and a few other features.","files":null}]}
