Sometimes I like to work with a set of two apps side-by-side on each monitor, but then switch to another set of two apps, and etc.\n\nRight now, to achieve this, I have to memorize two workspaces and also the combination so that I can open the desired workspace on each monitor. It is really no issue for the lettered workspaces since that's where assigned applications live, but for the numbered workspaces which I use as support, it is difficult to keep track of.\n\nIt would be ideal if I could manually group/ungroup workspaces through a `service` keybind of sort so that I don't have to commit to a hard-coded configuration (e.g., alt+; \u0026 g when desired workspaces are living on each monitor).\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
