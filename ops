The empty gap in tiles would make this intention clear\n\nThis is true for me, and is most often how i create my layouts. Every other time I end up in a one-child container (on i3) it is an accident and I undo it by hand.\n\nI just spent a while hunting on how to do this, then found this issue which mentioned splits.
