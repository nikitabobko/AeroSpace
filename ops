I don't like the \"colon implicity\" in i3 design.\n\nI'd introduce a new property for workspaces called \"tag\". The currently existing workspace \"name\" remains it's unique identifier, but \"tag\" is an optional arbitrary non-unique text shown after the \"name\" in the tray\n\nThe proposal:\n```\naerospace rename-workspace \u003cnew-name\u003e\naerospace rename-workspace --tag \u003cnew-tag\u003e [--name \u003cnew-name\u003e]\n```\n\n1. The first command would only rename the name\n2. The second command would rename the tag (and optionaly name in one go)\n\nIf a workspace named `\u003cnew-name\u003e` already exist, I'd swap the names\n\n---\n\nA convenience alias like this could be introduced: `aerospace rename-workspace \u003cnew-name\u003e:\u003cnew-tag\u003e`\n\nThough I need to forbid colon character in workspace names then","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1720111802,"nonce":"tIczBuETHOFA1avOz/6ZYbZjRE8=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6Dr-W4","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/245#issuecomment-2209342904"},"message":"It's not easy to implement, because a lot of code relies on the fact that workspace name is unique immutable identifier","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1730032973,"nonce":"oZwu/cFhv8HfhFb0pUad3w3KIjI=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6KRRKczwAAAAN5kDiG"},"added":["triaged"],"removed":[]}]}
