Finder plus one window never seems to exhibit this corrective behaviour.\n\n1. Open new Finder tab and get the ghost window\n2. _Switch Finder to floating_ #this is the key\n3. [Mess around with]* changing focus/moving windows and Finder will reinsert itself into the tiling tree correctly and the ghost is gone and focus navigation now works between app windows and across the Finder tabs.\n\nNOTES:\nFinder still seems to be in floating mode, even though it behaves like a tile (ie. when the extra tab is closed, Finder reverts to floating)\n\n*Mess around with:  Sometimes after floating the Finder, just an alt-arrow to switch focus will snap finder back into the tile layout, but sometimes it seems to need alt-shift-arrow (attempt to move the window) instead.\n\nOnce there are 3 or more tabs in Finder, the focus nav gets messy, as the tabs seem to be in an inconsistent horz/vert tile orientation, so alt-left/right to move focus across the windows might get stuck at one of the tabs and requires some alt-up/down to move focus across the tabs to then continue left/right on the other side to other windows.\n\nNot sure if this might be helpful info, but thought someone might be able to debug the behaviour and see whats happening under the hood for maybe discovering a way to identify tabs correctly and fix the issue...","files":null}]}
