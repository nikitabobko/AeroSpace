Well, there is an API, but it only works for windows of unfocused applications.\n\nUnfocused windows of the focused application, cannot be raised.\n\nAnticipating the suggestion to focus windows in the reverse order, API to focus window is the buggiest API I worked with. Trying to focus windows in the reverse order may end up in the wrong window being focused.\n\nSo, I'm preliminary closing this issue, since I am not aware of the ways to fix it.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1737229415,"nonce":"kWgRAXS7KskIfogA0vf9aqx+1RQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6SvTBSzwAAAAO43w2n"},"status":2}]}
