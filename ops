I want to bring terminal from workspace T to my current workspace E using a specific keybind, and when im done using the terminal i can use the same keybind to send the terminal back to workspace T.\n\nI've already been able to get something along the lines of that to work. Since I dont know if specific app windows can be grabbed through its id or not, ive basically gone around the issue and botched a few things up.\n\nThe way I have it set up right now, I have to use a keybinds to move the node from terminal to safari, and another keybind to move it back to T. And since I want to be able to do this with my vs code workspace as well, i have another two keybinds setup for that as well. (As well as another two for when i want to use VSCode+Safari)\n\n[aerospace_config.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15934019/aerospace_config.txt)\n\n\nThis achieves what I need, but its very demanding to remember all the combinations of different keybinds, for 3 different workspaces. I imagine it would be possible to use only a single keybind to achieve this if somehow the window can be grabbed through the app ID and not have to specify the workspace or the node everytime. So that the window gets grabbed regardless of which workspace its in.\n\nIs this currently possible? and if not, are there any plans of implementing a feature like this in the future? Thank you so much \u003c3","files":null}]}
