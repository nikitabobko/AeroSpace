In that case, the command will exit with non-zero exit code.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thatâ€™s why it may be preferred to combine focus-back-and-forth with workspace-back-and-forth:\n\u003e \n\u003e `aerospace focus-back-and-forth || aerospace workspace-back-and-forth`\n\nThis is bad and should be improved. We should store the whole focus history stack. Optionally making it available for users via smth like `list-focus-history-stack` (also see: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/942)","files":null}]}
