Right now it's not possible to interact with the nodes in a workspace level, so I have to `move-node-to-workspace` every node in the workspace, switch to that workspace, and then reorganize the layout again.\n\n### Hypothetical use case: \nYou have a mental picture set where `Workspace 1` is for your primary task, `Workspace 2` is secondary and so on. The task being performed on `Workspace 2` becomes irrelevant, so it has to give way somehow.\n\n### Suggested implementations:\n- Option 1: `switch-workspace-with`\nEffectively renames the active workspace with the specified one.\n- Option 2: `move-node-to-workspace` accepts optional parameter `--all` with `horizontal` or `vertical`\nTake all nodes of Workspace A and merge with Workspace B.","files":null}]}
