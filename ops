For example, I couldn't understand why my editor window wasn't tiling with a terminal window, until I realized I had accidentally made the editor window `floating`, and even so it wasn't clear where in the layout tree it was.\n\nI wished I had a command that could dump the layout tree, which would have helped me understand what was going on.","files":null}]}
