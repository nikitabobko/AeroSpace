Apparently, something major got broken, but I still can't reproduce the problem.\n\nPeople started coming only after 0.12.0-Beta. Is the problem reproducible in 0.11.2-Beta?\n\nBy looking at changelog between 0.11.2-Beta and 0.12.0-Beta https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/compare/v0.11.2-Beta...v0.12.0-Beta the only suspicious commit that could cause the problem is https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/commit/588f697b09f632576eb565ca3800d805c2eeb0d4\n\nI'd appreciate if somebody who has this problem could try to revert the commit and build from sources to see if it helps. Or otherwise try to bisect the problem between 0.11.2-Beta and 0.12.0-Beta. I assume that it's a 0.12.0 regression, so we need to confirm that first","files":null}]}
