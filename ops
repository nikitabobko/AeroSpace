Alternatively a shortcut for that could also work.\n\nI wonder if there is built-in way to do that, or maybe some API that I can explore to implement a script that I can run when switching workspaces?\n\nI tried working with `aerospace resize width -x` but that won't work for some reason.","files":null}]}
