Its definitely a breath of fresh air for those of us on macos with i3 envy!\n\nI spent 2 days with it (v0.5beta) and figured I detail my experience in case its useful (take it with a pinch of salt given my inexperience with the tool):\n\nGood\n1. docs are really nice and to the point\n2. installation is a breeze  (esp not having to deal with SIP shenanigans)\n3. I love the minimal menu-bar\n\nNeeds-work\n1. configurations are hit and miss. Reload would sometime take but say missed half the time. If lucky then there would be a parser error. Otherwise nothing but silent fail.\n2. focus stopped working randomly  (alt-h works but alt-l mysteriously stops working)\n3. Re-mappings did not always work. E.g. I can remap alt-enter. But exact same command with `alt-t` refuses to work. I double checked there are no duplicates or anything. `alt-t` keeps taking me to workspace=T. It would be helpful if I could make it dump out current key mappings for debugging.\n4. Relaunching causes quite a bit of mess. I suppose I can use the after-startup command to clean things up a bit\n5. docs mention v0.6 (e.g callback), but I could not find that version on the release page.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your hard work.","files":null}]}
