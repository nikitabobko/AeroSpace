Swapping essentially means moving all of the contents (and layout) of the current workspace to the other, and vice-versa.  This makes is possible to bring one workspace's contents \"near\" to other workspaces so that you can easily switch between them using 'workspace prev' and 'workspace next'.","files":null}]}
