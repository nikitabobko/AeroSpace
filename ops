I realize this is probably scriptable with the existing commands, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel if this is an existing recipe.\n\nIf needed, I can work on scripting this myself, but I figure it's still worth creating an issue for this for the purpose of future searchability so others can copy the result.\n\nCheers\n\n- [x] I've searched for duplicates.
