Really useful on large or ultrawide monitors. \n\nE.g., \n\n```\ngaps inner 10px\ngaps horizontal 500px\nsmart_gaps inverse_outer\n```\n\nWhen you only have one window on a workspace, this will put 500px on both sides of it. Opening a second window will remove the horizontal gaps. \n\nWhat do you think?","files":null}]}
