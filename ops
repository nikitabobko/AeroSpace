I love how lightweight and unobtrusive it is.\n\n**Question:**\nIs there a way to persist assignments to workspaces other than adding each individual app to the config? I have a lot of apps that I do not use often and that are specific to only one machine. Consequently, I'd rather avoid cluttering my config with these apps. However, I still want them to remain in the workspaces where I put them after reboots or application restarts.","files":null}]}
