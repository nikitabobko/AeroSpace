Key-code `q` is a key next to the `tab` key. If we wanted to automatically support layouts, then we'd need to subscribe for keyboard layouts changes (if Apple provides an API for it). When the keyboard layout changes, we'd need to translate key notations to key codes (if Apple provides an API for it), and \"remap\" our subscriptions for key codes\n\nAnd I don't even want to think what happens with non-Latin layouts, or when users have several Latin layouts\n\nThere are so many places where anything can go wrong with an automatic approach. That's why I think, it's more reliable to give users a way to remap keys manually\n\nApparently, skhd resolved these issues somehow, but I'm not going through this rabbit hole","files":null}]}
