But if you are not comfortable taking financial contributions I will respect that decision!","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1710495069,"nonce":"qUCJKfPRjKaREkbI0G+SMtYVSnc=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM53Klhs","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/51#issuecomment-1999263852"},"message":"This behavior seems to be back in recent versions.
