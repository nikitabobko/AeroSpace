To *correct* this behavior `URL.path` should be used instead. However this introduces a messier bug - more on this below.\n\nThe reason this behavior still works as well as it does is because the plist is written/deleted when app starts up/reloads config depending on the `start-at-login` value. When you next log in, the plist is automatically loaded by launchd or is missing so cannot be launched.\n\nRunning AeroSpaceApp from the terminal shows the following errors:\n```sh\n# output when the load fails:\nLoad failed: 5: Input/output error\nTry running `launchctl bootstrap` as root for richer errors.\n\n# output when unload fails:\nUnload failed: 5: Input/output error\nTry running `launchctl bootstrap` as root for richer errors.\n```\nYou can see slightly more detailed info in the launchd logs:\n```sh\n# here's one such example for a failed 'load'\n2024-08-30 16:58:28.718503 (gui/501 [100018]) \u003cNotice\u003e: Bootstrap by launchctl[21729] for //file:///Users/jake/Library/LaunchAgents/bobko.aerospace.plist failed (2: No such file or directory)\n```\n\n### The Messy Bug\nWhen `launchctl load some.plist` is ran and `RunAtLoad` is `true` in the plist, the program is immediately executed - this creates a second instance of AeroSpace and then everything gets wild. Hotkeys are handled twice, windows are moved erratically, and things become generally unpredictable. In my specific scenario, I had things set up in such a way that both instances were fighting over a window and I couldn't focus my terminal to kill the app. Don't ask me how because I'm not sure.\n\nThere are many solutions to this problem, such as a seperate startup helper app, creating a lockfile to ensure single instances etc. However I feel this is overkill, at least for a first pass solution.\n\nI think for now, it's safe to remove the calls to launchctl and just rely on the [lack of] presence of the plist and let macos do it's thing on login.\n\nSorry for the verbosity of this bug report. It's been a long day :)\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [X] I've searched for duplicates.
