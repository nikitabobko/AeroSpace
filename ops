There's no built-in command for this specific action in Aerospace but there is the \"resize\" command which I tried to use as a workaround by assigning `z = 'resize smart +10000'` in my config. \n\nThis *seemed* to be working until I moved focus to the \"hidden\" window, which results in Aerospace crashing. That is, if I use `resize smart +10000` on window 2 in the following layout and later try to focus on window 3, Aerospace stops.\n\n```\nh_tiles\n├── window 1\n└── v_tiles\n    ├── window 2 (resized)\n    └── window 3 (implicitly hidden)\n```\n\nI believe this is because aerospace is trying to focus a window that's actually off-screen. I don't know if it qualifies as a bug since it is mentionned in the guide that MacOS doesn't support having windows off-screen but still, if anyone knows a way around this problem, let me know!","files":null}]}
