I'm exploring tiling window managers for the first time and was assuming that `yabai` was the only option but was pointed towards `AeroSpace` as an alternative and like it a lot!\n\nI was wondering whether you're planning on supporting saving and restoring window layouts. Especially for my secondary monitor which I use for one or two of my workspaces with always the same set of applications arranged in the same layout, it would be fantastic to be able to set them up with one command on startup (and/or restore them later if they got mangled). i3 seems to support this: https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html\n\nThanks so much!","files":null}]}
