The events might come in whatever order, or sometimes the events might not be even delivered ðŸ¤· \n\nAeroSpace logic relies neither on the nature of the events nor on their order. AeroSpace only uses events as a signal to \"re-evaluate the world\" (check if windows no longer exist, check if new windows are appeared, re-layout the windows)\n\n**And here comes the problem**, whenever AeroSpace detects that the window is destroyed, AeroSpace issues a focus request to focus the previously focused window on the workspace of the destroyed window. We do so to keep the focused workspace focused (Pointer in the code: `MacWindow.swift:garbageCollect`). Unfortunately, AeroSpace plays a \"race condition\" game with the macOS that tries to focus next window of the app.\n\nIt leads to the following user facing issue: AeroSpace may lose the \"race condition\" https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/854 https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/571\n\nWhat is the proposed solution to fix the problem? I don't have one. I don't know. Until it's clear how to fix the issue, the issue exists for the documentation purposes.\n\nAlso read the thread: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/571","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1739717039,"nonce":"GREnhE9ei0xIZYz5Z0S4VPNC9Kk=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOJl1IZM6qPUEozwAAAAPNAq2f"},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]}]}
