Open a finder window. It joins the layout just fine.\n1. Open a new tab in the same finder window. Aerospace thinks it's a new window and adds it to the layout, but because it's not a window, there's empty space in its place, and when you navigate between windows using `focus` `left` and `right` it switches between those 2 tabs and moves the window between the 2 available slots in the layout.","files":null}]}
