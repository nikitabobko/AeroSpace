The problem I see is that AesroSpace assigns different \"names/numbers\" to the workspaces on each reboot. So, my config is useless because next time the names given are different.\n\nFor example, today I started Aerospace and numbers were 3 | 1 | 2 (Cool!). But next try they were not the same ( like 13 | 11 | 12 ). I've seen other random numbers and this is a no go for me.\n\nJust to give more information about my setup: I am using a 27 inch monitor as my main display, a MacBook as an extended display that drives the system, and a second MacBook Pro as a third monitor extending my setup (using duet display).\n\n I simply cannot understand the logic to assign display names, and why it changes so badly :/","files":null}]}
