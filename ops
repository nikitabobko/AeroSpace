(I'm curious whether the problem happens only when AeroSpace moves the windows at the bottom right corner, or whether it happens generally when it resizes/moves windows)\n\nYes, the affected window is animated in this case as well.\n\n\u003e If the answer is yes. Do you observe the same problem in Amethyst/yabai when changing layout/moving windows?\n\nHaven't tried.\n\n\u003e Did you try to reboot?\n\njup, still comes back\n\n\n\u003e I noticed this with specific windows. For me this never happens for any app except Firefox, Firefox animates every time (when moving window and when switching to a workspace with Firefox)\n\n90% of the time this happens for me on Firefox as well. I have seen iTerm2 and Discord show this behavior as well though.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1702462057,"nonce":"MXSvil4ngflYI2gpzqbJK1dkfBQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5ufABQ","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/51#issuecomment-1853620304"},"message":"\u003e If the answer is yes.
