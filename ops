Many thanks. Still learning bits and bolts in the past 2 days.\n\n# Disclaimer\nThis issue is not necessarily an AeroSpace issue since it relates to a screenshoting app called [flameshot](https://flameshot.org/docs/installation/installation-osx/) but I believe it relates to how AeroSpace manages windows and monitors.\n\n# Issue\nWhen taking a screenshot with flameshot, you can:\n\n- only see a \"smaller version of the screen\" to screenshot, it's like it's roughly minimised 3x times, truncated to the right and filled padding\n- only screenshot the 'main' screen (assigned as main screen in the Apple settings)\n- see a suspicious window bar\n\n# Environment\n- MacBook M1 - Sonoma 14.2.1 (23C71)\n- Screen space: Laptop screen + 2 external monitors\n- Flameshot v12.1.0 (96c2c82e)\n\n# Reproduce\nInstall flameshot by downloading it or via brew\n\nWhen taking a screenshot with flameshot (via keyboard shortcut) on the main screen, I get something like this on my Dell 30\" monitor \n![image](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/11454776/7487fe86-6253-4c62-85f2-aea390bd8ff7)\n\nInterestingly, I noticed that while in \"screenshot mode\" going to the top of screen shows a macos window bar. It's like flameshot gets its own window. \n![image](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/11454776/a6cb7df9-e00a-4e53-9bb8-dcc89a984939)\n\nPS: All screenshots have been taken with the MacOS tool showing flameshot taking a screenshot. Inception. \n\n# Workaround\nUse the MacOS screenshot tool and post edit the screenshot if required. Unfortunately, Flameshot is heaps better because of its simplicity and required tools to blur, highlight in seconds.\n\n# Questions\n- Is there a parameter or config bit to change to help with flameshot?\n- Is there another good screenshotter tool compatible with AeroSpace other than the Macos embedded tool?\n\nPS: I understand if this issue is out of the scope of AeroSpace and/or maybe a limitation or bug on the flameshot side.","files":null}]}
