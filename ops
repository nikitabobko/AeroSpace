Apologies if this has been submitted before, I'm sure I saw this somewhere but can't find it anymore.\n\nI commonly run a left + right configuration with 2 applications side by side.\nIt would be nice as a configuration option or a command to force all new windows to join the left or right already existing branch.\n\nThis is achievable via keystrokes, but I'm not sure if this can be achieved in the on-window create callback?\n\nSomething like:\n`[[on-window-detected]]\nrun = ['join-with right']`\n\nSo instead of:\n`App A | App B | App C`\n\nIt would add as:\n```\nApp A | App B\n             App C\n```\n\nI don't think this is doable with the current configuration, but it would be super nice to be able to essentially add to the bottom left or right leaf of the tree.","files":null}]}
