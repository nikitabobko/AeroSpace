See #77 \n\nAeroSpace could hardcode this knowledge about Discord misbehavior and run the `on-window-detected` callback every time Discord application unhides. But it will surprise people who directly use \"hide application\" on Discord, so I don't think that it could be fixed on AeroSpace side, it's a Discord bug.\n\nOn the related note, in the next version, windows will preserve their workspace assignment even when hidden #425 which might be coincidentally the behaviour you want.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1726001704,"nonce":"9YEXfR04lvFF9DGkDo80djVs++A=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6WDHiWzwAAAANOt_GS"},"status":2}]}
