If you switch workspaces frequently this get's tiring. \nSome heavier or electron based Apps like Slack are even slower. \n\nI'm not sure how solveable this is with the limits gives AeroSpace but I wanted to report it anyway. \n\n\nhttps://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/assets/9765622/f00aa679-3fa1-43a2-aa66-cc7f4a68c40a\n\n(The windows start at the top and you can see the bottom of the window resizing)\n\nPS: Outstanding project overall, thanks for your hard work making window management on macOS better!","files":null}]}
