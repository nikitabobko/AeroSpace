It's working great, I have nothing to complain about. The problem I'm facing has to do with the keyboard layout I am using, AZERTY (PC) on MacOS. I am programming a lot, and many symbols are only accessible through the AltGr key, e.g. AltGr+5. I cannot use this key because it automatically switches to another space or performs another action.\n\nIs it possible to differentiate between Alt and AltGr in the key mapping? This would solve the problem.","files":null}]}
