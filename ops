In my keyboard layout `alt-2` writes \"@\" and `alt-n `writes \"~\". The easies solution for me, the one I also used with Amethyst before was to use `hyper` key and `shift-hyper` combinations instead of `alt` and `shift-alt` (`ctrl-alt-cmd` mapped to `caps-lock` and `ctrl-alt-cmd-shift` mapped to `shift-caps-lock`). This works perfectly and I only wish if problems with key mapping were mentioned more in the documentation, or if there was an easier way of defining the modifier key like you can do with i3.","files":null}]}
