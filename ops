These are just two things that came to mind immediately when trying to solve this. I'm open to suggestions if this is a solved problem using the provided configuration, or otherwise. I think it'd be easily achievable using the CLI commands in a shell script but I'd appreciate a way for handling it within the config if possible.","files":null}]}
