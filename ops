My desk setup is I have A in a vertical orientation on the left (code monitor), connected via thunderbolt 4 daisychain to B in a horizontal orientation in the middle (main monitor), connected via thunderbolt 4 to my laptop on the right (messaging, spotify, etc). This means that when I sit down at my desk, I can just plug my laptop in to the single thunderbolt cable, and get charging, both monitors, ethernet (plugged into B), and my USB A keyboard (also plugged into B).\n\nRepro:\n\nVideo: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b9643af-ccf2-4ef0-9819-b2c5e7d02a6f\n\nAs you can see, B is detected first, and there's no issue there. However, A is quickly detected afterwards, and when Aerospace tries to redistribute windows at that point, it gets into this frustrating loop that takes a while to get past. In this example, it took around 16 seconds from detecting the third monitor to finishing the setup jitter, but other times it has taken even longer, sometimes even taking a full 45-60 seconds before settling down. I did find that unplugging A from B, plugging B into my laptop, waiting a few seconds, and then plugging A into B does significantly reduce the jitter time, but that isn't a great solution.\n\nAt first I thought this was related to #289, but I see that that seems to have been isolated to a change after 0.11.2, whereas I am having this issue on 0.11.1.\n\nLet me know if there's any more info I can provide, and thank you for this (otherwise) amazing tool!","files":null}]}
