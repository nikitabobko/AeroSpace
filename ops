Shouldn't it be handled purely by sketchybar?\n\n\u003e We could call it exec-on-monitor-change to follow the patter of the existing exec-on-workspace-change.\n\nI don't like `exec-on-workspace-change` callback, it's inconsistent with everything else. I hope that eventually `exec-on-workspace-change` will be replaced with: `on-workspace-change = 'exec-and-forget ...'`. But design questions of #278 and #351 has to be figured first","files":null}]}
