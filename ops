Starting at workspace 1 would make more sense and be more intuitive in most scenarios I think (in the top of the keyboard the first number to the left is 1, so for my first workspace I would look at 1), or at least include the possibility to declare them, like if a workspace is not associated with a shortcut in the config file then it is not enabled.\nI hope this is clear, and loving the window manager so far!","files":null}]}
