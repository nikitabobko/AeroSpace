With native workspaces macOS is capable to optimize the power consumption of apps by \"freezing\" their rendering (which can be observed with yabai + SIP/animations disabled), which I'm guessing could not be the case for virtual workspace, as the apps remain on the same native workspace, but hidden in the corner. Curious if this has already been considered/measured?","files":null}]}
