It essentially moves the single window through the stack and out the otherside before returning focus to the stack.\n```\n# Swap Stacks with Single\nalt-shift-ctrl-h = ['focus left', 'move right', 'move right', 'focus left']\nalt-shift-ctrl-l = ['focus right', 'move left', 'move left', 'focus right']\n```\nInstead of moving the focussed stack it instead moves the single node that is in the location I want the stack in. This will of course not work as expected if you are trying to swap two stacks","files":null}]}
