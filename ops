I suspect that Zoom has some mechanism to prevent it from being completely moved off-screen. However, Aerospace may not recognize this and repeatedly tries to move the window, causing the flickering and the high cpu usage.\nScreen recording:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ce1ae1-5f2c-4860-ae0c-56603a575f62\n\n\n\n\u003c!--\nConsider including in bug reports:\n- `aerospace debug-windows` output if applicable\n- Screenshots of problematic windows if applicable\n- Videos of problematic windows if applicable\n- Your config\n--\u003e\n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
