How does it work in yabai? What logic do you prefer and why? Or were you just curious?\n\nI chose to exit fullscreen mode on focus change because otherwise the layout would look weird - the fullscreen window would be overlapped by a smaller window \n\n\u003e Is it possible to make the third window to be \"smartly\" join with a window and become a h_tile node?\n\nAs for now, it's not possible","files":null}]}
