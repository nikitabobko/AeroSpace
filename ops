Been using aerospace for about a month and change.\n\n---\n\nAfter dealing with the delaying or freezing for my first two or so weeks of using `aerospace`, I just I went a couple of weeks without any delaying/freezing.\n\nI went as far as checking to see if there was a new aerospace release that got auto-updated or something, since it had gone from slow to fast out of nowhere.\n\nI didn't see a new release. That confused me.\n\n---\n\nAnywho, after that couple of weeks without any performance issues I ran my codebase's test suite, which is CPU intensive.\n\nAerospace immediately became slow, and remained slow even after my CPU load went back to 1-2%.\n\nOnce I restarted it, it was fast again.\n\nLooking back, for the two or so weeks where it was fast I had:\n\n1. Restarted aerospace because I was restarting my computer\n\n2. Not done anything CPU intensive for a couple of weeks\n\n3. As soon as I did something CPU intensive, it became slow again. Restarting aerospace made workspace switching fast again.\n\n---\n\nThe above suggests that this issue is not directly related to what applications you are running.\n\n**The slowness begins as soon as you do something CPU intensive, regardless of what application caused it.**\n\nPeople are reporting that they notice the problem when running intellij.\n\nI suspect that this is because intellij is something that people use to do CPU intensive things.\n\n---\n\nGiven that the problem immediately goes away once you restart aerospace, I'm inclined to believe that aerospace is capable of either fixing or working around whatever the problem is.\n\nFor instance, in the worst case aerospace could detect unusual slowness and do whatever it does when it restarts. (I am not suggesting that this is a good idea, just pointing one a brute force solution).\n\nIn the best case, we identify what aspects of aerospace could at all be related to this issue, narrow down the root cause, and fix it.\n\n---\n\nIn summary:\n\n- the above describes how to reproduce this issue\n\n- the issue seems solvable within aerospace, be it using a brute force solution or a more elegant one\n\n---\n\nPerformance issues have been on an intel mac.\n```\n2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9\n2019 MacBook Pro\n```","files":null},{"type":6,"timestamp":1723811593,"nonce":"STgm+AdSC+4WNsxpRTeQCjmKBY0=","metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lALOJl1IZM6Isu7bzk1ogvA"},"target":"326408d59129e2d2ac253c057bd9db1a4a33b4baa02c4433a7847f2e68e4c065","message":"I am able to reliably reproduce the problem.\n\n---\n\nAfter dealing with the delaying or freezing for my first two or so weeks of using `aerospace`, I just I went a couple of weeks without any delaying/freezing.\n\nI went as far as checking to see if there was a new aerospace release that got auto-updated or something, since it had gone from slow to fast out of nowhere.\n\nI didn't see a new release.
