Help wanted!","message":"Right now, AeroSpace doesn't have an icon, but it would be cool to design one.\n\nI would appreciate it if someone skilled from the community could contribute to the project by creating the icon. I can draw a basic icon on my own, but it would likely resemble a simplistic drawing made by a 5-year-old using GIMP.\n\nFor inspiration: \n1. The \"AeroSpace\" name means a **space** for your windows without friction (the \"aero\" part). \n2. I myself consider the virtual emulation of workspaces to be the strongest feature of the AeroSpace. If I could disable the workspace switching animation in yabai or Amethyst (with SIP enabled, of course), I'd probably not bother myself creating AeroSpace. That's what the \"space\" part in the app name means. It resembles the strongest feature of AeroSpace - work**spaces**","files":null}]}
