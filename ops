I fully agree that on a large display a small potion of pixels for accordion gaps is a good trade off for providing context. But on a 14\" laptop screen, setting all gaps to 0 was the first thing I changed in the default AeroSpace config. I also don't need a reminder for the accordion orientation because I only have it set horizontally (I don't really care which way, but unless I work on a vertical monitor, I don't need both orientations). Having windows in fullscreen also removes distractions and eases OCD. I actually enjoy how I configured AeroSpace with default gapless accordion layout because it forces most windows to fullscreen and I don't have to constantly fight MacOS tendency to instill \"creative mess\" on my desktop. I still appreciate AeroSpace's workspace organization and tiling layout is indispensable on large (for me only external) monitors.","files":null}]}
