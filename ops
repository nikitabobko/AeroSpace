For example\n```toml\nalt-q = 'workspace ●○○○'\nalt-w = 'workspace ○●○○'\nalt-e = 'workspace ○○●○'\nalt-r = 'workspace ○○○●'\nalt-cmd-q = 'move-node-to-workspace ●○○○'\nalt-cmd-w = 'move-node-to-workspace ○●○○'\nalt-cmd-r = 'move-node-to-workspace ○○●○'\nalt-cmd-e = 'move-node-to-workspace ○○○●'\n```\nwould give you a text ui of dots.
