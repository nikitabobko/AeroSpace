Also, I use their feature, which opens new links in the so-called \"small browser,\" which can be closed if you don't want to open this link in the main space. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- open Arc browser in the space\n- open any link in a small browser (I open links from the messenger which is float mode)\n- close small browser\n\n**Actual result**\nThe empty space that was occupied by the small browser stays, and the main browser window is not resized. The empty space after the small window is closed is still registered as a window, and I can switch to it. \n\n**Expected result**\nThe small browser is closed, and the main browser window is resized.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1726574328,"nonce":"ydwM2tRqkTg3z8uI47BqsD3q1OE=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM6MZjTK","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/514#issuecomment-2355508426"},"message":"Adding info to my previous message - when it happens, It stops going to the messenger window, which is in float mode.
