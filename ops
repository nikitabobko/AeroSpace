Once again thanks to @xuyixin1996 for the investigation! There are two factors necessary to reproduce the issue:\n1. `Displays have separate Spaces` have to be enabled\n2. The most bottom right monitor shouldn't be configured as main monitor. Partially related to https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/149\n\nOutcomes:\n1. Since 0.14.0, it's recommended to keep `Displays have separate Spaces` disabled https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#a-note-on-displays-have-separate-spaces\n2. The issue should be fixed since 0.14.0. But please make sure that your monitor arrangement is properly configured: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement (or you can disable `Displays have separate Spaces`)\n\nI'd love to hear the confirmation from someone that the issue is fixed in 0.14.0 for them as well","files":null}]}
