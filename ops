It works when it is called in zsh. It could probably caused by parsing the command incorrectly like using `'` instead of `\"` in bash script.\n\nThe config is as follows:\n```toml\n# Send node to prev workspace\n    alt-shift-tab = ['move-node-to-workspace $AEROSPACE_PREV_WORKSPACE', 'workspace $AEROSPACE_PREV_WORKSPACE']\n```\n\nWhile typing `aerospace move-node-to-workspace $AEROSPACE_PREV_WORKSPACE` in zsh works.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"492\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fd5736f-6aee-4fb8-8464-ac8853a5b86e\"\u003e","files":null}]}
