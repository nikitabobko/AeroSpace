Install goes well (following the brew install from the manual), I added the .aerospace.toml i3 config and it starts, shows the application in the top bar, but nothing works keyboard wise. \n\nWhat am I missing / doing wrong? It just does nothing, no matter what I press alt-1, alt-j, etc. I tried the other modifier keys but nothing works. Must be something silly I am overlooking? I am on Sonoma.","files":null}]}
