Usually this is at some point in the working day when I'm done talking to humans and want to move my e-mail client and Slack out of view, and continue looking at the IDE and web browser I have open in the same workspace.\n\nThis becomes more valuable as screen size increases as well. On a 5120x1440 screen, I'll often have 3 or 4 panes spread horizontally, some of which are horizontal stacks of 2 or more windows (usually terminals). If I want to move that stack to the edge of my screen, I have to do a bit of a dance to achieve this, usually by moving other windows in the root of the tree around the stack I actually want to move. I guess this particular use case could be handled with a \"move window to far right of root\" command instead, but that's still moving other windows around the leaf I wish to change.\n\nHope this made sense","files":null}]}
