I decided not to implement `container` boundary and `wrap-around-container` boundary action. If I implemented `container` boundary, I'd need to implement `focus child|parent` which I don't want to do (see #5)\n\n2. I implemented the mentioned flags as `focus` command options `focus --boundaries \u003cboundary\u003e --boundaries-action \u003caction\u003e`. I don't want to introduce config options that change the behavior of commands. It would make scripting harder (also see #43 Same reasons)\n\nPlease let me know if you disagree","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1702845439,"nonce":"6HXe1Z6qs2CLnFrpVNgiA+8xWvY=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOJl1IZM5u0lJL","github-url":"https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/23#issuecomment-1859277387"},"message":"Released in 0.7.0-Beta","files":null}]}
