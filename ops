I can overlay one window (often the one I'm writing in) on top of another (often the one I'm reading from) - then on a laptop with a small screen I find it much nicer than a split view because you can see more stuff at once. So this is my argument that opacity _is_ a practical feature - although I appreciate it's quite niche.\n\nAlso the only way I've found to get transparency is with yabai, and that requires disabling SIP for transparency to work (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection), so maybe it's not even possible to implement while keeping the constraint of not requiring users to disable SIP.","files":null}]}
