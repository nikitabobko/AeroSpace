Plugging in an external monitor, the second display gets assigned an 11th workspace, for which there naturally does not exist any keybinding in my config, so I can't navigate to it or move windows to it.\n\nIn general, if there are X workspaces in the config, plugging in an external monitor creates an (X + 1)st workspace.\n\nWhat I would expect to happen is that one of the existing workspaces moves to the new display (the one targeted by `workspace-back-and-forth` seems like a natural choice when going from 1 to 2 displays, not sure how to pick that workspace when going to more than 2 displays).","files":null}]}
