If workspace `a` is focused and has *only* windows of app `A` on it and the before-that-most-recently-focused window of app `A` is on `b`, and the current window (of app `A`) on `a` is closed, then the workspace is switched to `b`. This does not happen if `a` has a window from a different app on it.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Pick any app (say, Safari)\n- Open a Safari window on workspace 1\n- Open two Safari windows on workspace 2\n- Switch to workspace 1\n- Switch to workspace 2\n- Close the current window (on workspace 2)\n\nExpected behavior: Workspace 2 remains active and the remaining Safari window is focused.\n\nActual behavior: Workspace 1 becomes active and its Safari window is focused.\n\nThis also happens when workspace 2 only has one window, i.e., with the following steps:\n- Pick any app (say, Safari)\n- Open a Safari window on workspace 1\n- Open one Safari windows on workspace 2\n- Switch to workspace 1\n- Switch to workspace 2\n- Close the current window (on workspace 2)\n\nExpected behavior: Workspace 2 remains active (empty).\n\nActual behavior: Workspace 1 becomes active and its Safari window is focused.\n\n**Related issues you could find**\n\nThis is a variant of #571 and probably more-or-less the same issue.","files":null}]}
