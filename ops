Love it so far. \n\nI'm having an issue though with lettered workspaces. Some letters work such as U and M but others such as ASDFXW don't. That means I can't use `alt-s` to open that workspace nor `alt-shift-s` to move a node to that work space. \n\nHas someone ran into this before? \n\n## Checklist\n\n\u003c!-- Please fill in the checklist.
