I have attempted the following methods:\n\n1. `defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture YES`: This does not work on macOS 14.4.1 (Sonoma). Additionally, this method does not allow customization of the default modifier key (\u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ecmd\u003c/kbd\u003e).\n\n2. Running Yabai with only mouse features (Yabai has built-in support for resizing and moving windows with modifier+mouse). I understand this might seem a bit ridiculous. It did not work: the windows can be moved or resized by Yabai, but it seems that AeroSpace forces them to remain in their original positions.\n\n   ```sh\n      # set mouse interaction modifier key\n      yabai -m config mouse_modifier cmd\n\n      # set modifier + left-click drag to move window\n      yabai -m config mouse_action1 move\n\n      # set modifier + right-click drag to resize window\n      yabai -m config mouse_action2 resize\n\n      # disable Yabai window management\n      yabai -m rule --add app=\".*\" manage=off\n      ```\n3. Trying other tools just for resizing or moving windows, such as [easy-move-resize](https://github.com/dmarcotte/easy-move-resize), it works when AeroSpace is not running. However, when AeroSpace is active, it behaves similarly to the Yabai case.\n\nWill it be possible to add this feature to AeroSpace? \n\nBTW, as a lost child from i3wm/swaywm to macOS, AeroSpace gives me the most similar experience to i3wm/swaywm. Thanks for your amazing work! :kissing_heart:","files":null}]}
