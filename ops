I successfully implemented this approach: https://github.com/frostplexx/AeroSpace/tree/monospace-menubar, and it generally works well, except for a few minor fixable bugs.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"266\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6c05d7f-887e-4adb-b68b-17663abdc43c\"\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"274\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bd112d5-6426-472e-879c-06afc39915be\"\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"420\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573bba94-af72-4106-b9d1-0e3533b479bd\"\u003e\n\nThe code is a bit messy, but it would also allow us to use any arbitrary SwiftUI view as the menu bar icon.\nAdditionally, it would enable the use of custom fonts (configured by the user in the config file). For instance, users can set the workspace names to icons of their choice using a nerd font.\n\u003cimg width=\"265\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c431dd5-2be1-46c8-b976-223a8889ce9f\"\u003e","files":null}]}
