However the default font doesn't lend itself very well to this purpose as the different numbers/letters, have different widths, causing other menubar items to jump when switching spaces. The use of a monospaced font would alleviate this. \n\nFor example the MacOS default clock in the right of the menu bar seems to be using the equivalent of CSS: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;` to prevent jumping.","files":null}]}
