When users unhide/unminimize windows, shall I re-attach the windows to where they were in the tree? Or shall I rather attach them to the currently active workspace?\n\n\u003e If you describe your use cases, it will help to make the right decision\n\nI've previously used Amethyst, and in Amethyst, handling this scenario is akin to closing a window. Unhiding the application is treated as adding a new node. That's what I'm used to. I also use i3, and if someone were to inquire about the 'right' approach, I'd be at a loss :)\n\nHonestly, I'm not overly concerned about where the window gets added. I just find the gaps left behind a bit jarring.","files":null}]}
