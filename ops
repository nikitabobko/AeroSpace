Caused by: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/445 It's because the current algorithm of saving state before the screen is locked is incorrect. To fix it, we should rewrite make `TreeNode` immutable https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1215, which will make it a breath to take snapshots of the tree on its every modification before windows start \"dying out\" when the screen is locked.\n\n**2.** During high CPU usage / when apps are slow at responding AX requests. When AeroSpace checks for dead windows, it doesn't distinguish between long responses and `nil` response. Though it's a hypothesis, which should be investigated","files":null}]}
