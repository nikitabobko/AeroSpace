One of the stated project values of AeroSpace is to avoid things like private APIs as much as possible so I wouldn't expect @nikitabobko to accept a PR copying the AltTab implementation over - though I'd be happy to be proven wrong\n\nI think for aerospace a great option would be to just have a `mark-tab` API similar to what @FormalSnake described, to mark a given window as belonging to a tab. That could help to incrementally work towards a solution for this. `mark-tab` as an API could allow one to set up a global keybinding for cmd-t that runs something like `aerospace mark-tab --focused \u0026\u0026 osascript new_tab.scpt \u0026\u0026 aerospace mark-tab --focused --join-with-last` where the `new_tab.scpt` uses the New Tab menu bar item of the app to make a new tab. It wouldn't be perfect but the same thing could later be used if keybindings per app get implemented","files":null}]}
