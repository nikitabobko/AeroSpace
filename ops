I was also one that did not \"understand\" it when I heard, but I guess it's one of those things you need to try and then you cant live without it. Please reconsider. \n\nI just had to buy a Mac as backup/testing laptop but normaly am on Arch/Hyprland. Without Aerospace (or Yabai, we will see) I'd just hate every second on this thing.\n\nPoint with scratchpads in Hyprland is that they're like modals with slightly dimmed overlay and they steal focus. Apps in them (mostly only one), can be as small or as large as you want, so, if they're smaller, they do not cover background apps no matter from which workspace you called it. And thats what makes it so much better than \"Normal\" workspace. It doesn't interrupt your focus as much. it's less invasive.\n\nFew examples for what I use them every day:\n- Whatsapp - quickly see/reply and go back to work.\n- Spotify - obvious\n- remote terminal sessions, or shells with log outputs - rarely need it, but when I do, I dont want to loose focus from my main Workspace\n- time tracker\n\nSo, some above (Whatsapp and Spotify) have rules to move to their respective scratchpads automatically when opened. But some (remote sessions or similar) I manualy move to a scratchpad when I need them. \n\nCurrently testing Yabai and Aerospace and this is a big disadvatage for Aerospace when it comes to my preferences.","files":null}]}
