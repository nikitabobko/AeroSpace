Much better than the alternatives.\n\n# Issue\nWhen I have a chrome window with multiple tabs, if I use the mouse to click on a tab and pull it out of the current window, 2 things can happen:\n1. If I do it quickly and let go of the mouse as soon as the tab is out of the current window, it works fine and joins the current layout.\n2. If I delay it by anything around a second or more, it ends up as a floating window, that I then have to join into the current layout with `layout floating tiling`","files":null}]}
