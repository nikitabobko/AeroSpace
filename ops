The XMonad model seems in some sense to be more 'object oriented' because it treats a `Workspace` as an entity that possesses a tag (name), layout (method for distributing windows), and stack (like a circular list of windows with a cursor).  Each physical display is represented as a `Screen` which points to / possesses a `Workspace`, along with information that ties it to a particular display.\n\nIt seems that using a `Map\u003cString, Workspace\u003e` still requires some additional synchronized data structure to represent order -- either that, or you need to sort items in the map every time you want to move to the \"next\" or \"previous\" workspace.  To me that seems more complex than just using a single ordered list, and there's no reason you couldn't enforce uniqueness on workspace names if desired at the time that a new workspace is created.\n\nCommunicating order would not be any easier if you change order by renaming -- assume some script performs a rename / swap, and later another script needs to know what the current order is -- it would need to query a list of names in this case (or mirror its own state of the set of names, which may be prone to error).  Querying an ordered list of names is what would be needed for the \"non-map\" case, or if desired one could refer directly to current indices of workspaces in the list.\n\nI hadn't thought about the desire to maintain keybindings to a fixed workspace, but that makes sense.  I was actually thinking that it would be nice to be able to have keybindings that take me to a specific location in the workspace list (e.g. alt-1 takes me to index 1 of the list, no matter what workspace is located there).  Maybe there would be a way to do both? (e.g. something like `workspace 2` takes you to the workspace at index 2, and `workspace \"2\"` takes you to the workspace named `2`, or maybe a special prefix for indices like `idx:2`)","files":null}]}
