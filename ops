The definition of \"node\" includes windows and containers. Restricting nodes max width will effectively restrict the root container width, which is no different from having big gaps.\n\nMy vision was different. I planned to introduce `windows-max-width`, and it would restrict only windows width, leaving containers width flexible. I lean towards restricting windows width because the more windows you have, the bigger becomes the total max width restriction (which should work nicely for the ultrawide monitor use case). Though I just realized that this vision has unfortunate feature interaction with mouse resizing.\n\n---\n\nAnother thing is where to store \"max width restriction\". According to your description, you want to store it in the nodes/windows themselves. This way it's possible to resize nodes/windows independently\n\nMy vision was to have as many `windowsMaxWidth` as many monitors there are, and disallow resizing bigger than max width.\n\nSince the primary use case is to improve experience for ultrawide monitors, it feels natural to me that `windowsMaxWidth` is a property of every monitor. And your idea to store \"windows max width\" in windows themselves isn't yet intuitive to me. \n\nI understand that \"isn't yet intuitive to me\" is a bad argument, and I will try add a comment later when I realize it. Maybe my intuition is afraid that every window will now have a property that is not directly observable (which feels too chaotic and random), or maybe it's something different, I didn't realize it yet.\n\n\u003e We introduce a new layout command `layout tiling-fullwidth` that allows for hotkeys that disable the constraint.\n\nWhat would be the use case for disabling the constraint?\n\n\u003e resize should learn to set maxwidth for nodes specifically like `resize max-width 800`, this enables setting some types of windows to be constrained by default like so:\n\nAnd I afraid that possibility to set `max-width` for every specific window encourages too much tinkering. I still yet lean more towards \"windows max width per monitor\" approach.","files":null}]}
