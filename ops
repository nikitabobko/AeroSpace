When I have one window only it still creates space for another and it seems broken. I need to use fullscreen for each app to be able to work with Aerospace.\n\nHere is how I can move window by keybinding:\n```\ncmd-alt-shift-j = 'move down'\ncmd-alt-shift-k = 'move up'\n```\nI'm using `layout tiles horizontal vertical`. `accordion` layout seems to work fine.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b47aaaf0-4ff9-4828-91f6-9568bafba68d","files":null}]}
