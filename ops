I appreciate the detailed instructions and the potential fix you've committed to the main branch.\n\nI've installed the latest commit `0ab5fde` using the `aerospace-dev` cask and reinstalled the Contexts app. Here are my observations so far:\n\n- When I open two Finder windows on an empty space and close the second one immediately, the first window expands as expected to fill the width of the screen. This is working well!\n- However, I encountered an issue when I open a second window, move focus to the first window, and then close the second window using the mouse. In this scenario, the first window does not expand. To resolve this, I have to switch to another space and back (or execute another AeroSpace command) to clean up the ghost window.\n\nI'll continue testing under different conditions, including those you mentioned (e.g., sleep mode, screen locking, etc.), and will report back with any further findings. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to test.\n\nThanks again for your efforts!","files":null}]}
