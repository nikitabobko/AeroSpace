When a window closes, AeroSpace tries to keep the focus on the currently focused workspace, but if the timing is wrong it doesn't always succeed even with a single monitor, not to mention two monitors. I might come up with ideas on how to better handle it, but right now it's indeed unreliable\n\n\u003e but for floating windows I think it might be interesting if you use the `move` command\n\nYes, it should work like that, I just didn't have time to implement it. For floating windows, `move` command should move windows in the appropriate direction. An optional `--floating-pixels \u003cpixels\u003e` flag could be introduced to configure how far the window should be moved. Feel free to open a new issue if you want to be able track the progress on this feature. Also it's very easy to implement, so feel free to submit a PR","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1736690199,"nonce":"RL6J0odJnmTmGmJHjX/zRKdmc78=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOJl1IZM6PxqGtzwAAAAOzefiR"},"status":2}]}
