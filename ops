However, much of the time that monitor is actually displaying workspace `8`. I also am using the `on-window-detected` callback to make any subsequent mail windows float (which is working). \n\nHowever, my issue is that if I'm working on my primary monitor (workspace `1`) and I receive an email. If I open the email by clicking the notification as it arrives in the top right of my monitor then the new email opens floating in my main monitor on workspace `1`. Which is perfect. However, my secondary monitor switches from whatever workspace it's on currently to workspace `0` which also has the main mail window open. Is there a way to avoid this? I'd prefer the secondary monitory stay on the workspace it's currently on.","files":null}]}
